 Hello, Chicago! It's good to be home. If I had told you eight years ago that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto industry, and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history. If I had told you that we would open up a new chapter with the Cuban people, shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program without firing a shot. Take out the mastermind of 9-11. If I had told you that we would win marriage equality and secure the right to health insurance for another $20 million of our fellow citizens, if I had told y'all that, you might have said our sights were set a little too high. But that's what we did. I can't do that. After my election, there was talk of a post-racial America. And such a vision, however well intended, was never realistic. Race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society. If you're tired of arguing with strangers on the internet, try talking with one of them in real life. If you're disappointed by your elected officials, grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office yourself. Show up. Dive in. Stay at it. Sometimes you'll win. Sometimes you'll lose. Michelle Lebahn Robinson, girl of the South Side. We made the White House a place that belongs to everybody. And the new generation sets its sights higher because it has you as a role model. Malia and Sasha, of all that I have done in my life, I am most proud to be your dad. For too many of us, it's become safer to retreat into our own bubbles, whether in our neighborhoods or on college campuses or places of worship or especially our social media feeds. Surrounded by people who look like us and share the same political outlook and never challenge our assumptions, and increasingly we become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information, whether it's true or not, that fits our opinions. Instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out there. I'm asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents, that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists, that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice, that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from the foreign battlefield to the surface of the moon. A creed at the core of every American whose story is now yet written. Yes we can. Yes we did. Yes we can. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you. God bless you.
