 You're watching football? There's no fooling you. No, what is this sack statistic they put up there? Well, I know about sacks of my mother's shops there. Sacks. Sacks. It's football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage. Huh. It's scrimmage. The line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offense from the defense. Oh. Sheldon knows football? Apparently. I mean, Quidditch. Sure, but football. Sheldon, how do you know this stuff? I grew up in Texas. Football is ubiquitous in Texas. It's pro football, college football, high school football, P-We football. In fact, every form of football except the original, European football. Most Texans believe to be a commie plot. Unbelievable. If you're interested, I also know all about frying meat that isn't chicken as if it were chicken. So, you could teach me? Football or chicken fried meats? Football. I'm going to pennies on Saturday to watch a game with their friends, and I don't want to look like an idiot. I want to blend in. I want to blend in with pennies' friends. I think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage. But Sheldon, please teach me football. It'd be fun. That's exactly what my father said. Come to the games, watch the games, week in and week out. From the time I was five until I went off to college, longest seven years in my life, please, I'm asking you as a friend. Are you making this a Tier 1 friendship request? Yes. Fine. I really appreciate this. Yeah, yeah. Alright, point next. Sit down, shut up and listen. I'm sorry? That's how my father always began our football conversations. Even if you'd like, after the game, I'll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to raccoon that it craps itself.
