INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
IIT Delhi offers various Undergraduate, Post Graduduate and Ph.D. Programms at the undergraduate level, IIT 
Delhi provides science-based engineering education with a view to produce quality engineer-scientists. Every 
B.Tech. student needs to do compulsory foundation courses in the areas of basic sciences, humanities, social 
sciences and engineering sciences apart from departmental requirements in his/her core engineering discipline. 
Departmental courses (core and electives) constitute about half of the total curriculum. Further, students do 
open category electives to develop broad inter-disciplinary knowledge base or to specialize significantly in 
an area outside the parent discipline. Many activities are included in the undergraduate curriculum as non-
graded core with a view to enhance the quality of learning. The curriculum provides broad based knowledge 
and simultaneously builds a temper for a lifelong process of learning and exploring. At present, IIT Delhi offers  
14 B.Tech., 3 Dual Degree (integrated B.Tech. and M.Tech.), and 1 B.Des. programmes.
IIT Delhi also offers multiple Postgraduate Programmes (M.Sc./M.Tech./M.S.(Research)/M.Des./M.B.A./M.P.P./ 
Ph.D.) through its Departments, Centres, and Schools. Currently, there are 37 M.Tech., 8 Interdisciplinary M.Tech., 38 
M.S.(R.), 5 M.Sc., 1 M.Des., 3 M.B.A. (including part time), 1 M.P.P., 1 PG Diploma, and 31 Ph.D. programmes offered 
by different academic units.  In addition, there are 2 joint Ph.D. and 1 joint PG Diploma programmes being offered in 
collaboration with partner institutions. The Institute has multiple courses at appropriate levels to cater to the academic 
requirements of the Postgraduate students. New courses are also being continuously added to the existing pool of PG and  
Pre-Ph.D. courses. At the postgraduate level, students are also encouraged to look beyond their area of specialization 
to broaden their horizons through open electives and self-learning. 
The medium of instruction in the Institute is English.
The Institute follows a semester system. An academic year typically runs from July through June next year and is 
essentially comprised of two semesters. Typically, the 1st semester starts in the last week of July and ends in the 1st 
week of December; the 2nd semester starts in the 1st week of January and ends in the 2nd week of May. Additionally, the 
summer semester which starts in the 3rd week of May and ends in the 2nd week of July, is utilized in some exceptional 
cases. Detailed schedule is given in the Semester Schedule that is made available before the start of each semester.
1.2 Departments, Centres and Schools
Each course is offered by an Academic Unit which could be a Department, a Centre or a School. The names of 
Departments, Centres and Schools and their two-letter codes are given in Table 1. Some programmes are offered 
jointly by multiple academic units and are classified as interdisciplinary programmes; their codes are given in Table 2.

COURSE STRUCTURE AND CREDIT SYSTEM
2.1 Course Numbering Scheme
Normally every course at IIT Delhi runs for the full length of the semester. Only exception is for V-type courses which 
may run for part of the semester. A student registers in advance for courses that he/she wants to study and at the 
end of the semester a grade is awarded. On obtaining a pass grade, the student earns all the credits associated 
with the course while a fail grade does not get any credit. Partial credits are not awarded.
Each course is denoted by a unique code consisting of three alphabets followed by three numerals:
}
Course prefix for the academic 
unit offering the course. See 
Table 1 for all prefixes.
Nature of the course.

500 level courses 
: 
Courses for M.Sc. programmes.
 
 
These courses are not open to other students.
600 level courses 
: 
Preparatory/introductory courses for M.Tech. and advanced courses for M.Sc. 
programmes. 500 and 600 level courses are normally not open to UG students.
700 - 800 level courses 
: 
Core and elective courses for M.Tech., M.Des., M.B.A., M.S.(Research) and Ph.D. 
programmes. Usually 800 level courses are advanced courses for PG students.
2.2 Credit System
Education at the Institute is organized around the semester-based credit system of study. A student is allowed to 
attend classes in a course and earn credit for it, only if he/she has registered for that course. Prominent features 
of the credit system are a process of continuous evaluation of a studentâs performance/progress and flexibility to 
allow a student to progress at an optimum pace suited to his/her ability or convenience, subject to fulfilling minimum 
requirements for continuation and within the maximum allowable period for completion of a degree.
A studentâs performance/progress is measured by the number of credits that he/she has earned, i.e. completed 
satisfactorily. Based on the course credits and grades obtained by the student, grade point average is calculated. A 
minimum grade point average is required to be maintained for satisfactory progress and continuation in the programme. 
Also, a minimum number of earned credits and a minimum grade point average should be acquired in order to qualify 
for the degree. All programmes are defined by the total credit requirement and a pattern of credit distribution over 
courses of different categories as defined in sections 4 and 5 for UG and PG programmes respectively.
2.3 Assignment of Credits to Courses
Each course has a certain number of credit(s) or non-graded unit(s) assigned to it depending upon its lecture, tutorial 
and laboratory/practical contact hours in a week. This weightage is also indicative of the academic expectation that 
includes in-class contact and self-study outside class hours.
Lectures and Tutorials 
: 
One lecture or tutorial hour per week over the period of one 14 week semester is 
assigned one credit.
Practical/Practice 
: 
One laboratory/practice hour per week over the period of one 14 week semester is 
assigned half credit.
A few courses are without credit and are counted under non-graded (NG) courses.
Example : Course COL334 Computer Networks; 4 credits (3-0-2)
The credits indicated for this course are computed as follows:
3 hours/week lectures 
 = 3 credits
0 hours/week tutorial 
 = 0 credit 
 
 
Total = 3 + 0 + 1 = 4 credits
2 hours/week practicals 
 = 2 Ã 0.5 = 1 credit 
Total contact hours for the course = (3 h Lectures + 0 h Tutorial + 2 h Practical) per week 
 
 
 = 5 contact hours per week for 14 weeks.
For each lecture or tutorial credit, the self-study component is 1-2 hours/week (for 100-600 level courses) and 3 
hours/week (for 700-800 level courses). The self-study component for practicals is 1 hour for every two hours of 
practicals per week. In the above example, the student is expected to devote a minimum of 3 + 1 = 4 hours per 
week on self-study in addition to class contact of 5 hours per week.
2.4 Earning Credits
At the end of every semester, a letter grade is awarded in each course for which a student had registered. On 
obtaining a pass grade, the student accumulates the course credits as earned credits. An undergraduate student 
has the option of auditing some courses within the credit requirements for graduation. Grades obtained in audit 
courses are not counted for computing of grade point average. However, a pass grade is essential for earning 
credits from an audit course. Section 2.9 defines the letter grades awarded at IIT Delhi and specifies the minimum 
grade for passing a course.

2.5 Description of Course Content
Course content description consists of following components: (i) Course Number, (ii) Title of the Course, (iii) Credit 
and L-T-P, (iv) Pre-requisite(s) and overlapping courses, if any, and (v) List of broad topics covered in the course. 
Content descriptions for all courses are given in section 10 of this document. An example course content description 
of a 100 level course is as follows:
MTL100 Calculus
4 Credits (3-1-0)
Review of Limit, Continuity and Differentiability, uniform continuity, Mean Value Theorems and applications, 
Taylorâs Theorem, maxima and minima, sequences and series, limsup, liminf, convergence of sequences 
and series of real numbers, absolute and conditional convergence.

Double and triple integration, Jacobian and change of variables formula. Parametrization of curves and 
surfaces, vector fields, divergence and curl, line integrals, Greenâs theorem, surface integral, Gauss and 
Stokes theorems with applications.
2.6 Pre-requisite(s)
Each course, other than 100 level courses, may have specified pre-requisite(s) which may be other course(s), or 
a minimum number of earned credits, or both. A student who has not obtained a pass grade in the pre-requisite(s) 
specified or has not earned requisite number of credits will not be eligible to register for that course. For example:
TXL372 Speciality Yarns and Fabrics
2 Credits (2-0-0)
Pre-requisite(s): TXL222 and TXL232
A student who has obtained a pass grade in TXL222 and TXL232 will be eligible to register for this course.
For UG students, the Pre-requisite(s) for some courses of special nature are given below.
 
Independent Study 
65 earned credits
 
Mini Project 
65 earned credits
 
Minor Project (Dual Degree) 
100 earned credits
 
B.Tech. Project Part - I 
100 earned credits
 
B.Tech. Project Part - II 
Minimum B Grade in B.Tech. Project Part - I
 
M.Tech. Major Project Part-I (Dual Degree) 
135 earned credits
In addition to any pre-requisite specified for 700 and 800 level courses, a UG student needs to earn 75 and 100 
credits to register for 700 and 800 level courses, respectively.
2.7 Overlapping/Equivalent Courses
Wherever applicable, overlapping and equivalent courses have been identified for each course. A student is not 
permitted to earn credits by registering for more than one course in a set of overlapping / equivalent courses. 
Departments / Centres / Schools may use these overlapping/equivalent courses for meeting degree / pre-requisite 
requirements in special circumstances. For example:
CLL113 Numerical Methods in Chemical Engineering
4 Credits (3-0-2)
overlaps with: MTL107, MTP290, MTL445, CVL734, CoL726
A student who has earned a pass grade in CLL113 will not be eligible to register for MTL107, MTP290, 
MTL445, CVL734 or CoL726. An overlapping course cannot serve as a substitute for a core course of 
his / her programme. In the above example, if MTL107 is a core course for a student, he / she is not 
allowed to register for CLL113 as a substitute for this core course.

2.8 Course Coordinator
Every course is usually coordinated by a member of the teaching staff of a Department/Centre/School in a given 
semester. This faculty member is designated as the Course Coordinator. He/she has the full responsibility for 
conducting the course, coordinating the work of other members of the faculty and teaching assistants involved 
in that course, administering assignments, conducting the tests as well as moderating and awarding the grades. 
For any difficulty related to a course, the student is expected to approach the respective course coordinator 
for advice and clarification. The distribution of the weightage for tests, quizzes, assignments, laboratory work, 
workshop and drawing assignment, term paper, etc. that will be the basis for award of grade in a course will be 
decided by the course coordinator of that course, in consultation with other teachers involved, and announced 
at the beginning of the semester.
2.9 Grading System
The grade obtained in a course reflects a studentâs performance in the course. While relative standing of the 
student is indicated by his/her grades, the process of awarding grades is not necessarily based upon fitting the 
marks scored by the students to some statistical distribution. The course coordinator and associated faculty for 
a course formulate appropriate procedure to award grades that are reflective of the studentâs performance vis-
Ã -vis the expected learning outcomes of the course.
2.9.1

Description of grades
A grade
An âAâ grade stands for outstanding achievement. The minimum marks for award of an âAâ grade is 80 %. However, 
individual course coordinators may set a higher marks requirement for awarding an âAâ grade.

Text on page:16
Courses of Study 2023-2024
11
C grade
The âCâ grade stands for average performance. This is the minimum grade required to pass in the Major Project 
Part 1 and Part 2 of Dual degree and 2 year M.Tech. and M.S.(R) Programmes.
D grade
The âDâ grade stands for marginal performance; i.e. it is the minimum passing grade in any course excluding the 
M.Tech. Major Project. The minimum marks for award of âDâ grade is 30 %. However, individual course coordinators 
may set a higher marks requirement.
E and F grades
A student who has scored at least 20% aggregate marks in a subject can be awarded an âEâ Grade. The Course 
Coordinators are, however, free to enhance this limit but should keep the percentage about 10% less than the  
cut-off marks for âDâ Grade. The Course Coordinators can also specify any additional requirements (to be specified 
at the beginning of the Semester) for awarding âEâ Grade. Students who obtain an âEâ Grade will be eligible to 
appear in a repeat major test (re-major test), an examination with weightage same as that of Major test, for only 
lecture courses (âLâ Category Courses described in section 2.1). If they perform satisfactorily, they become eligible 
for getting the grade converted to a âDâ Grade, otherwise they will continue to have âEâ Grade. The student will 
have only one chance to appear for re-major for an âEâ Grade. The re-major test will be conducted within the first 
week of the next semester. The date of re-major test of Institute core courses for undergraduate students will be 
centrally notified, while for all other courses, the date would be announced by the respective course coordinators. 
A student can appear for a maximum of three such re-major tests in a given semester. If a student cannot appear 
for the re-major test due to any reason(s), he/she will not get any additional chance.
If a student with âEâ grade in a course does not pass the course through a re-major test or obtains an âFâ grade in 
the course, he/she has to repeat the course if it is a core course. In case the course is an elective, the student 
may take the same course again or any other course from the same category. âEâ and âFâ Grades are not counted 
in the calculation of the CGPA; however, these are taken into account in the calculation of the SGPA. (Please see 
2.10 for definitions)
I grade
An âIâ grade is temporarily awarded to a student on his/her request to denote incomplete performance in L (lecture), 
P (practical), V (special module) category courses. Requests for âIâ grade should be made at the earliest but not 
later than the last day of major tests.  An âIâ grade is awarded in case of absence on medical grounds or other 
special circumstances, before or during the major examination period, provided the student has met the attendance 
criterion of the course. Attendance in the course for which âIâ grade is being sought will be certified by the course 
coordinator of the course.
The course coordinators can instruct all students awarded âIâ grade as well as âEâ grade to appear for a common 
re-major test. All evaluation requirements for such students in the corresponding course(s) should be completed 
before the end of the first week of the next semester. Upon completion of all course requirements, the âIâ grade is 
converted to a regular grade (A to F, NP or NF).
NP and NF grades
These grades are awarded in a course that the student opts to audit. Only elective courses can be audited. Auditing 
a course is allowed until a date stipulated in the semester schedule. The audit pass (NP) grade is awarded if the 
studentâs attendance is above 75% in the class and he/she has obtained at least âDâ grade. The course coordinator 
can specify a higher criterion, at the beginning of the semester, for audit pass. If the stipulated requirements are 
not fulfilled, the audit fail (NF) grade is awarded. The grades obtained in an audit course are not considered in the 
calculation of SGPA, CGPA or DGPA. However, for undergraduate students, the credits will be counted in total 
earned credits in the respective category, subject to the maximum allowable limit for audit.
W grade
A âWâ grade is awarded in a course from which the student has opted to withdraw. Withdrawal from a course is 
permitted until the date specified in the Semester Schedule. Withdrawal from PG major project part 2 is allowed 
only if he/she is given semester withdrawal. The W grade is mentioned on the grade card.

Courses of Study 2023-2024
12
X grade
The âXâ grade is awarded for incomplete work in Independent Study, Mini Project, Minor Project, or Major Project 
Part-1 and Part-2, based on the request of the student. On completion of the work, âXâ grade can be converted to 
a regular grade within the first week of the next semester. Otherwise, the student will be awarded âXâ grade on a 
permanent basis and it will appear in his / her grade card. Further, the student will be required to register for the 
course in the next semester. The credits of the course will be counted towards his / her total load for the semester. 
In case of Major Project Part-1, the student will not be permitted to register for Major Project Part 2 simultaneously 
as Major Project Part-1 is a pre-requisite for Major Project Part-2. A regular full-time student can be awarded âXâ 
grade only once in a course, other than the summer semester. A part-time M.Tech. student is permitted a maximum 
of two X-grades in the Major Project Part-2.
S and Z grades
The âSâ grade denotes satisfactory performance and completion of a course. The âZâ grade is awarded for non- 
completion of the course requirements, and if it is a core course, the student will have to register for the course 
until he/she obtains the âSâ grade. The specific courses in which âSâ or âZâ grades are awarded for undergraduate 
students are:
(i) 
Introduction to Engineering and Programme
(ii) 
Language and Writing skills
(iii) 
NCC / NSO 
OOo/ NSS
(iv) 
Professional Ethics and Social Responsibility
(v) 
Communication Skills / Seminar
(vi) 
Design / Practical Experience
Besides, summer / winter internships in some PG programmes are also awarded S / Z.
2.10 Evaluation of Performance
The performance of a student will be evaluated in terms of three indices, viz., the Semester Grade Point Average 
(SGPA) which is the Grade Point Average for a semester, Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) which is the 
Grade Point Average for all the completed semesters at any point in time, and Degree Grade Point Average (DGPA). 
Degree Grade Point Average (DGPA) is calculated on the basis of the best valid credits in each category, after 
graduation requirements in all categories are met.
The Earned Credits (E.C.) are defined as the sum of credits for courses in which a student has been awarded pass 
grades. Points secured in a semester =Î£ (Course credits Ã Grade point for all courses in which pass grade has 
been obtained). The SGPA is calculated on the basis of grades obtained in all courses the student registered for, 
in the particular semester, except audit courses.
 
SGPA  =
 
Points secured in the semester
 
 
 
Credits registered in the semester, excluding audit and S/Z grade courses
The CGPA is calculated on the basis of pass grades obtained in all completed semesters, except audit courses 
and courses in which S/Z grade is awarded.
 
CGPA  =
 
Cumulative points secured in courses with pass grades
 
 
 
Cumulative earned credits, excluding audit and S/Z grade courses
Examples of these calculations are given in Tables 4(a) and 4 (b).

On completing all the degree requirements, the degree grade point average, DGPA, will be calculated and this 
value will be indicated on the degree/diploma. The DGPA will be calculated on the basis of category-wise best 
valid credits required for graduation.
A student, who has earned the requisite credits but does not meet the graduation DGPA requirement, may do 
additional courses in any elective category to meet the DGPA requirement within the maximum permissible 
time limit.

3. 
REGISTRATION AND ATTENDANCE
3.1 Registration
Registration is a very important procedural part of the academic system. The registration procedure ensures that 
the studentâs name is on the roll list of each course that he/she wants to study. No credit is given if the student 
attends a course for which he/she has not registered. Registration for courses to be taken in a particular 
semester will be done according to a specified schedule before the end of the previous semester. Each student 
is required to complete the registration process on the web-based system. The student must also take steps to 
pay his/her dues before the beginning of the semester. Students who do not make payments by a stipulated date 
can be de-registered for the particular semester.
Students have to report on the date prescribed by office of Dean Academics to mark his/her attendance in person, 
before the start of Semester. This is a requirement for validation of registration of existing students.
In-absentia registration or registration after the specified date will be allowed only in rare cases at the discretion 
of Dean, Academics. In case of illness or absence during registration, the student should intimate the same to  
his/her Programme Coordinator and Dean, Academics.
Brief description of registration related activities is given in the following paragraphs. The relevant dates are 
included in the Semester Schedule that is made available before the start of the semester. There may be changes 
in the schedule and/or procedure of registration from time to time. The students are intimated through e-mail about 
any such change to the e-mail address allocated to each student by the Institute at the time of admission. This 
e-mail address is the only channel through which the Institute would communicate with the student. For 
cyber security reasons, e-mail accounts / kerberos logins that are not used for a certain length of time are 
disabled and such accounts locked / deleted by the Institute. Students must therefore login into their e-mail 
accounts / kerberos logins regularly.
3.2 Registration and Student Status
Failure to register before the last date for late registration will imply that the student has discontinued studies and 
his / her name will be struck off the rolls.
All registered students, except part-time postgraduate students and visiting students, are considered as full-time 
students at the Institute. They are expected to be present at the Institute and devote full time to academics and 
co-curricular and extra-curricular activities in the campus.
3.3 Advice on Courses
At the time of registration, each student must finalize the academic programme, keeping in view factors such as, 
minimum / maximum numbers of total and lecture credits, past performance, backlog of courses, SGPA / CGPA,  
pre-requisite(s), work-load and studentâs interests, amongst others. Special provisions exist for advising academically 
weak students. Details are given in section 4.7.
3.4 Validation of Registration
Before the commencement of classes of each semester, on a date specified in the Semester Schedule, every 
student including part-time students, is required to be present on campus and validate his / her registration by 
logging into the website. Students who do not do registration validation will not be permitted to add / drop courses.
3.5 Minimum Student Registration in a Course
Undergraduate courses (of 100, 200, 300, or 400 level) and M.Sc. courses (500 or 600 level) will run if a minimum 
of 12 students register for the course. Under special circumstances, a departmental elective course may be  
allowed to run with minimum registration of 8 students, with prior permission of Chairperson, Senate. A 700 or 800 
level course can run with a minimum of 4 students. This requirement will be verified on the last date for Add / Drop. 
Courses without the minimum enrolment will be dropped. The students who had registered for these courses will 
be de-registered, and they will be given one more day for adding a course in lieu of the dropped course.
3.6 Late Registration
For reasons beyond his / her control, if a student is not able to register or send an authorized representative 
with a medical certificate, he / she may apply to the Dean, Academics for late registration. Dean, Academics will 

Text on page:21
Courses of Study 2023-2024
16
consider and may approve late registration in genuine cases on payment of an extra fee called late registration 
fee. Late registration is permitted until a date specified in the Semester Schedule, typically one week after the 
beginning of the semester.
3.7 Add/Drop, Audit and Withdrawal of Courses
a) 
Add / Drop: A student has the option to add courses that he / she has not registered for or drop courses 
for which he/she has already registered for. This facility is restricted to a period stipulated in the Semester 
Schedule, during the first week of the semester, subject to vacancy status of the courses concerned.
b) 
Audit: A student may apply for changing a credit course to an audit course before a deadline specified in 
the Semester Schedule.
c) 
Withdrawal: A student who wants to withdraw from a course should apply before a deadline specified in the 
Semester Schedule. A withdrawal grade (W) will be awarded in such cases.
Appropriate web-based applications are to be used for availing of the above-mentioned options.
3.8 Semester Withdrawal
 Semester withdrawal and absence for a semester under different conditions, viz. (i) medical and personal 
grounds (ii) industrial internship (iii) exchange / deputation to another academic institution in India or abroad, 
and (iv) disciplinary condition can be granted on application. The condition as per the following should be clearly 
specified in the application. 
(a) 
Semester Withdrawal (SW) reflects the condition, in which a student is forced to withdraw from all courses in 
the semester for medical conditions, or for a part-time student when he / she is sent for an outstation assignment 
by his / her employer. A student can apply for semester withdrawal if he / she has missed 20 or more teaching 
days on these grounds. Under no circumstances will an application for semester withdrawal be accepted 
after the commencement of major tests. A student is not permitted to request for semester withdrawal with 
retrospective effect.
(b) 
Semester Leave (SL) indicates the situation in which a student is permitted to take one or more semesters off 
for industrial internship or any other assignment with prior approval and planning. The application is to be routed 
through his / her advisor / programme coordinator and Head of the concerned Department / Centre / School. 
Dean, Academics is the final approving authority for such requests. All such applications must be processed 
before the beginning of the semester in which the leave will be taken. At present, UG students are allowed 
one extra semester for completion of the programme for every semester leave for industrial internship. Such 
students are permitted a maximum of two semesters of leave. The full-time 2 year M.Tech. / M.S.(R) students 
would be permitted a maximum of one semester leave for industrial internship or other assignment as approved 
by the Dean. These semesters will not be counted towards the maximum permitted time period for completion 
of the degree similar to the provision for UG students.
(c) 
When a student registers at another academic institution in India or abroad with the expectation of credit 
transfer or research work through a pre-approved arrangement including an MoU, the student should be 
considered as being on a Semester Exchange (SE). The SE period will be counted towards the total period 
permitted for the degree.
(d) 
When a student is suspended for one or more semesters on disciplinary grounds, the student status should 
be called Disciplinary Withdrawal period (DW).
(e) 
UG student may go for a long Internship or spend a semester on a Technical Start-up with the prior approval 
of the DPE Committee of the Department.
3.9 Registration in Special Module Courses
Special module courses, i.e. âVâ-category courses, are 1 or 2 credit courses that can be offered at the beginning 
of the semester and the regular registration procedure will be followed. A âVâ-category course may also be 
offered during the semester. In such a case, students will be allowed to add this course before classes for the 
course begin. These courses will usually cover specialized topics that are not generally available in the regular 
courses. Eligible students can register for these courses. The course coordinator will evaluate the studentsâ 
performance and award a letter grade. The credits so earned will count towards the appropriate category for 
degree completion purposes.

3.10 Registration for Non-graded Units
Details pertaining to registration and other modalities of earning non-graded units are given in Section 8 of  
this booklet.
3.11 Pre-requisite Requirement(s) for Registration
A student can register for a course only if he/she fulfills the pre-requisite requirement(s). Request for relaxation 
of pre-requisite requirement(s) may be raised by students under special circumstances. Such a request needs 
approval of the Departmental Faculty Advisor and Chairperson Grades and Registration.
3.12 Overlapping/Equivalent Courses
A student is not allowed to earn credits from two overlapping/equivalent courses. Overlapping/equivalent courses, 
wherever applicable, are specified in the Description of Course Contents.
3.13 Limits on Registration
An undergraduate student should register for a minimum of 12 credits in a semester. The number of credits a UG 
student can register in a semester will be limited to 24 for the first 5 semesters with a provision to allow registration 
upto 26 credits for upto 2 semesters during the entire period of study. A student on probation can register upto 
18 credits in a semester. This can be relaxed in 8th / 10th or later registered semester for B.Tech. /Dual Degree 
students, respectively.
3.14 Registration and Fee Payment
Every registered student must pay the stipulated fees in full before the specified deadlines. In the event that a 
student does not make these payments, he/she can be de-registered from all courses and his/her name can be 
struck off from the rolls.
3.15 Continuous Absence and Registration Status
If a student is absent from the Institute for more than four weeks without notifying the Head of Department /  
Centre / School or Dean, Academics, his / her registration will be terminated and name will be removed from the  
Institute rolls.
3.16 Attendance Rule
It is mandatory for the students to attend all classes. Attendance Records of all students for each course will be 
maintained.
The Course Coordinator will announce the class policy on attendance with respect to grading etc., at the beginning 
of the semester. This shall be done keeping in mind the importance of classroom learning in the teaching-learning 
process. Once the class attendance policy has been made clear to all the students registered for the course, the 
Course Coordinator will implement the same in totality.
For the purpose of attendance calculation, every scheduled practical class will count as one unit irrespective of 
the number of contact hours.
Attendance record will be maintained based upon roll calls (or any equivalent operation) in every scheduled lecture, 
tutorial and practical class. Students are required to strictly adhere to and comply with any method or device 
employed by the Course Coordinator / Instructor for purpose of Attendance Recording. Failure to do so may call for 
disciplinary action. The course coordinator will maintain and consolidate attendance record for the course (lectures, 
tutorials and practicals together, as applicable).
A Course Coordinator may choose any one or more of the following as attendance policy.
(a) The Course Coordinator can assign 10% of the total marks to surprise quiz(zes). If attendance of 
the student is greater than 90%, result of the best three quizzes will be considered, else average 
of all quizzes will be considered.
(b) The Course Coordinator can allocate specific marks for participation in discussions in the class on 
a regular basis.

(c) If a studentâs attendance is less than 75%, the student will be awarded one grade less than the actual 
grade that he/she has earned. For example, a student who has got an A grade but has attendance less 
than 75% will be awarded an A (-) grade.
(d) A student cannot get NP for an audit course if his/her attendance is less than 75%.
The Course Coordinator can implement any other attendance policy provided the policy is approved by the Dean, 
Academics.
Attendance statistics will also be used in the following way:
(a) If a studentâs attendance is less than 75% in more than two courses without any valid reason in a 
semester, he/she will be issued warning and put under probation. If this is repeated, he/she will not be 
allotted a hostel seat in the next semester.
(b) If a studentâs attendance is less than 75% in any course or CGPA is less than 7.0, then he/she will not 
be eligible to hold any position of responsibility in the hostel/institute in the next semester.

The 11 units listed in Table 7 will be core requirement for students of all undergraduate programmes with entry 
year 2020 or later. A student must earn these 11 units over the complete duration of the programme with special 
requirements for each  component as explained in Section 8. A student must get âSâ grades to earn these units. 
Incomplete performance in these components will be indicated by a âZâ grade.
For components 3-6 in the above table, a special portal called the NGU portal is used for necessary approvals and 
posting of âSâ grades. This portal can be accessed at https://ngu.iitd.ac.in/index
A brief description of the six components is given below. For complete details, please refer to Section 8.
(a) 
Introduction to Engineering and Programme (NIN100) (1 unit)
 
This course will introduce the students to the vast domain of Engineering in general with a glimpse of the 

Text on page:27
Courses of Study 2023-2024
22
specifics of various engineering disciplines. All students will be required to register for this course in the first 
semester for earning 1 unit. These may involve  listening to guest lectures, interaction with distinguished 
alumni, simple product building and product dissection exercises, executing simple design thinking exercises, 
visit to laboratories (in and outside the Institute) and industry.
(b) 
Language and Writing Skills (NLN100 and NLN101) (2 units)
 
All students will be required to participate in Task-Based Language Learning (TBLL) exercises in the first 
year, through two core courses: NLN100 in first semester and NLN101 in second semester.  These language 
games are designed to enhance their linguistic capabilities in comprehension, both reading and listening, as 
well as improve their ability to structure and compose ideas in spoken and written communication. Wherever 
necessary principles of English Grammar will be discussed along with the nuances of technical writing. The 
Language Needs of a particular class of students will be assessed through an initial language test at the 
beginning of the first semester. Then, the exercises will be tailored according to the specific language needs 
of the particular class of students. These exercises could be scheduled during normal academic hours or 
outside. Based on the performance and regularity, a student may be prescribed additional self-learning 
exercises and practice sessions during vacations as well, as requirement for securing an âSâ grade.
(c) 
NCC/NSO/NSS (NCN100/NSN100/NPN100) (Minimum 1 and Maximum 2 units)
 
NCC/NSO/NSS also form part of the core requirement of the degree. Students will be required to earn at 
least 1 unit from these activities involving 40 hours of work and a maximum of 2 units for 80 hours of work 
towards the total NGU requirement.
(d) 
Professional Ethics and Social Responsibility (PESR) (Minimum 1 and Maximum 2 units)
 
There is increasing consensus worldwide that professional ethics need to be incorporated into the 
engineering curriculum to provide students exposure to the kind of professional and ethical dilemmas 
they might face on an individual basis as well as the larger ethical aspects of technology development. 
Workshops, discussions/debates will be organized to sensitize students about Professional Ethics and 
Social Responsibility (PESR). This component has 3 core courses: NEN100 in first semester, NEN101 in 
2nd semester and NEN300 after 3rd year corresponding to a total of 1 unit. Students can earn an extra 
unit through additional activities, such as PESR workshops (NEN202) and PESR projects (NEN203). For 
more details, please see Section 8.4.
(e) 
Communication Skills/Seminar (1 unit)
 
Communication Skills is an essential requirement for a modern engineer. As a part of the degree 
requirements, undergraduate students will have to earn 1 unit in communication skills by registering for a 
seminar course or an equivalent activity. Please see Section 8.5 for details.
(f) 
Design and Practical Experience (Minimum 3 and Maximum 5 units)
 
The objective of this non-graded core requirement component is to give opportunities to students to acquire 
substantial design and practical experience both as a part of formal courses as well as in an informal setting. 
Second and even more important objective of this course is to inculcate design thinking among students and 
facilitate gaining some design immersion experience. Design and Practical Experience (DPE) component 
is introduced to promote learning by doing which does two important things: it allows students to immerse 
themselves in the environment in which work is to be done, so that they can understand the values and 
expectations of the target beneficiaries. Secondly, it enables a fresh look at problems, not only at the ways 
of defining them, but also at the ways to solve those including skill-sets that are required to address them. 
A shift from problem-based learning (acquisition of knowledge) to project-based learning (application of 
knowledge), where the projects are grounded in problems outside the classrooms and labs in everyday 
scenarios, will involve students in reality, and reality in education. Design and Practical Experience bridges 
division between the curricular and the co-curricular and encourages curiosity and involvement that arise 
out of total absorption in a subject of interest. Non-graded units in Design and Practical Experience can 
be earned through one or more of the following:
â¢ 
Specialized Elective Courses related to Design and Practical Experience (Maximum 2 Units)
â¢ 
Regular Courses with optional Design and Practical Experience Component (Maximum 2 Units)
â¢ 
Summer/winter/semester/SURA/DISA projects with Institute faculty, not evaluated for earning credits  
 
(Maximum 2 units)

â¢ 
Co-curricular projects such as Robocon, SAE-minibaja, etc. (Maximum 2 Units)
â¢ 
Summer Internships with Industry (Maximum 2 Units)
â¢ 
One Semester Internship (Maximum 5 Units)
â¢ 
Workshop Module on Design and Practical Experience offered by Faculty/Visitors (1 Unit each)
â¢ 
Section 8.6 gives complete details for this component.
4.4 Minimum and Maximum Durations for Completing Degree Requirements
(a) 
The minimum and maximum permitted duration of each academic programme will be determined in terms 
of number of registered regular semesters, hereinafter called registered semesters. Any semester in which 
a student has registered for a course will be called a registered semester subject to the following:
 
(i) 
Only the First and Second semesters of an academic year can be registered semesters. The summer 
semester will not be counted as a registered semester.
 
(ii) 
A semester when a student has been granted semester withdrawal or granted semester leave will not 
be considered as a registered semester.
 
(iii) The semester when a student is suspended from the Institute on disciplinary grounds will not be counted 
towards the number of registered semesters.
 
(iv) A semester in which a student is allowed by the Institute to undergo semester - long internship will be 
counted as a registered semester.
The summer semesters shall normally be available for earning credits. However, after the student has 
registered for the maximum permissible number of registered semesters, the subsequent summer semesters 
will not be available for earning credits.
(b) 
The minimum and maximum permissible number of registered semesters for completing all degree 
requirements are defined in Table 8.

4.5 Absence During the Semester
(a) 
A student must inform the Dean, Academics immediately of any instance of continuous absence from classes. 
(b) 
A student who is absent due to illness or any other emergency, up to a maximum of two weeks, should 
approach the course coordinator for make-up quizzes, assignments and laboratory work.
(c) 
A student who has been absent from a minor test due to illness should approach the course coordinator for 
a make-up test immediately on return to class. The request should be supported with a medical certificate 
from Instituteâs medical officer. A certificate from a registered medical practitioner will also be acceptable 
for a student normally residing off-campus provided registration number of the medical practitioner appears 
explicitly on the certificate.
(d) 
In case a student misses a minor test on the same day on which he / she has appeared in another test, a 
medical certificate from the instituteâs medical must be submitted.
(e) 
In case of absence on medical grounds or other special circumstances, before or during the major examination 
period, the student can apply for âIâ grade. At least 75% attendance in a course is necessary for being eligible 
for request of I-grade in that course. An application requesting I-grade should be made at the earliest but not 

Text on page:29
Courses of Study 2023-2024
24
later than the last day of major tests. An online application should be made by the student. On submission 
of a medical certificate / Deanâs permission, the Academic Section verifies the certificate and forwards the 
request to the concerned course coordinator. The course coordinator verifies the attendance requirement and 
forwards the application to the Head of the Department / Centre / School of the studentâs programme. Headâs 
approval is contingent upon the satisfaction of attendance requirement. On approval, an âIâ grade is awarded 
to the student. All evaluation requirements for students with âIâ grade should be completed before the end of 
the first week of the next semester. Upon completion of all course requirements, the âIâ grade is converted to 
a regular grade (A to F, NP or NF). 
(f) 
In case the period of absence on medical grounds is more than 20 working days during the semester, a student 
may apply for withdrawal from the semester, i.e. withdrawal from all courses registered that semester. Such 
application must be made as early as possible and latest before the start of the major tests. No applications for 
semester withdrawal will be considered after the major tests have commenced. Dean, Academics, depending 
on the merit of the case, will approve such applications. Partial withdrawal from courses registered in a 
semester is not allowed.
(g) 
If a student is continuously absent from the institute for more than four weeks without notifying the Dean 
Academics, his/her name will be removed from institute rolls.
4.6 Conditions for Continuation of Registration, Termination/Re-start, Probation 
and Warning
During the first two registered semesters of an undergraduate(B.Tech./Dual Degree) programme, a student is 
registered for a total of 34 credits, besides non-graded units. By the end of the first two registered semesters, not 
including summer, a student is expected to earn a minimum number of credits (excluding non-graded units) as 
specified in Table 9, in order to continue registration. If a student does not meet this criterion, his/her performance 
is classified as âPoor Performanceâ, and he / she may opt to start the programme afresh, or else his/her registration 
will be terminated.  This option to re-start the programme is available to a student only once.

Restart (Once only) / Termination of 
registration
(a) 
If a student chooses to restart after the first two registered semesters, then his/her credits earned and 
semesters registered will not be carried over. The re-start will be indicated on the transcript. The re-start will 
be permitted only once. If at the end of two registered semesters after re-start, the earned credits are less 
than or equal to 22 for GE / OBC or less than or equal to 18 for SC / ST / PD students, then the registration will 
be terminated.
(b) 
Each student is expected to earn at least 12 credits in each registered semester with an SGPA greater than 
or equal to 5.0. If the performance of a student at the end of any registered semester is below this minimum 
acceptable level, then he / she will be placed on probation, a warning shall be given to him / her and intimation 
sent to the parents.
(c) 
A student placed on probation shall be monitored, including mandatory attendance in classes, special tutorials 
and mentoring. Mentoring would comprise structured guidance under a senior / postgraduate student.
(d) 
If the performance of a student on probation does not meet the criterion in item (b) in the following registered 
semester, then the student would face termination, and will be permitted to register by the Dean, Academics only 
if the department makes a favourable recommendation. The Head of the Departmentâs recommendation shall 
be prepared after consultation with the student, and should include (i) feasibility of completing the programme 
requirements, and (ii) identification of remedial measures for the problems leading to poor performance.

programme. A student opting for such a programme shall be permitted two additional registered semesters 
for completing degree requirements as indicated in Table 8.
(b) 
In the slow paced programme, the upper limit for credits registered in a semester will be 18. A student in this 
programme is expected to earn at least 9 credits with minimum SGPA of 5.0 in any semester, falling which 
he / she will be issued a warning and placed on probation. 
 
A student placed on probation would be monitored, including mandatory attendance in special tutorials and 
mentoring.
 
If the performance of a student on probation does not meet the above criterion in the following registered 
semester, then the student would face termination and will be permitted to register by the Dean Academics 
only if the department makes a favourable recommendation. The Head of the Departmentâs recommendation 
shall be prepared after consultation with the student, and should include (i) feasibility of completing the 
programme, and (ii) identification of remedial measures for the problems leading to poor performance.
(c) 
The semester-wise schedule of the slow-paced programme shall be defined by the respective department 
for each student.
4.7 Scheme for Academic Advising of Undergraduate Students
Advising Scheme for Regular Students

Advising Scheme for Academically Weak Students
(a) 
The students on probation in each batch will be put under a special advisor, identified by the department, 
who is expected to monitor the students on probation in a personalized manner. Normally, not more than 5-8 
students would be assigned to a special advisor. Heads of Departments will appoint special advisors at the 
beginning of an academic session. 
(b) 
A meeting of the special advisors with Dean, Academics would be held at the beginning of each semester 
for coordination of the advising process.
(c) 
A student on probation is expected to be in close contact with the advisor by meeting him / her at least once 
every 3 weeks for the entire period during which the student continues to remain in probation. Special advisors 
will be invitees to the class committee meetings.
(d) 
Special advisor in consultation with the parents and student counsellor, if required, will make a student-specific 
academic plan. The special advisor is expected to: 
 
â¢ 
Closely interact with the weak student and his / her parents
 
â¢ 
Formulate individualized academic plan 
 
â¢ 
Manage and track counselling process of the student, if any, in coordination with the Associate Dean, 
Student Welfare.
 
â¢ 
Approve their registration
 
â¢ 
Manage the recommendation / appeal for termination / continuation process in consultation with Head of 
the Department and Dean, Academics.
(e) 
At the time of registration for a semester, the student meets his / her advisor if possible with parents, to:
â¢  Identify specific problems and ways to mitigate the same
â¢  Formulate academic plan and target(s) for the semester
â¢  Help Head of the Department in the processing of the studentâs appeal against termination, if applicable
â¢  Approve the registration of the student online.
(f) 
The student being placed under probation for the first time may also meet the counsellor during this period, 
if needed. The counsellor can provide professional help in identifying to resolving problems. Counsellorsâ 
input will be available to the special advisor. During the add-drop period, the student, preferably along with 
his / her parents, should come and meet the Counsellor.
(g) 
While considering any appeal from an academically weak student for continuation of his registration, the 
Dean, Academics would consider the following: 
 
(i) 
whether he/she has met his / her Advisor and Counsellor at the scheduled times on a regular basis and
 
(ii) 
whether he/she is regular in help sessions.
 
 
Registration of a student under probation will not be approved for the next semester if he/she does not 
comply with the process of meeting the advisor and counsellor. He / she will then be required to withdraw 
from the semester. 
(h) 
A student on probation will not be permitted to contest for any position of responsibility. However, he / she will 
be permitted to participate in extra-curricular activities in a restricted fashion only on specific recommendation 
of his / her advisor. 
An Institute level committee known as the Welfare Committee would monitor the entire operation of academic 
advising for weak students. Functions of the Welfare committee include monitoring the performance of weak students 
and making the final recommendations regarding termination/ continuation, restarting first year and slow-paced 
programme requests. This committee would also evaluate the weak students based on the feed-back regarding
 
(i) 
regularity in meeting the advisor and / or counsellor
 
(ii) 
studentâs attendance in help sessions and 
 
(iii) academic performance.
A summary of the weak studentâs performance would be made available to the class committee members, Head  
of the studentâs Department as well as Course Coordinators of the courses in which the student is currently  
registered.

Student Mentors
(a) 
Each student will be assigned a student mentor from the same hostel and preferably from the same discipline 
to mentor students on academic and extra-curricular activities and provide feed-back to the advisor and 
counselor in case of weak students. 
(b) 
There are individual incentives for good student mentors. Also, hostels performing well on mentoring benefit 
in terms of points towards BSW trophy.
4.8 Capability Linked Opportunities for Undergraduate (B.Tech./Dual Degree) Students
A student registering for 24 credits in each semester after first year and 26 in two semesters can complete a 
maximum of 182 credits. Since the graduation requirement for 4-year B.Tech. programmes varies between 148-158 
Earned Credits, it will be feasible for capable students to add value to their degrees by registering for additional 
courses of their choice.
Students can make use of these additional credits in two blocks of 20 credits to opt for:
 
(a) Minor / Interdisciplinary Area Specialization
 
(b) Departmental Specialization
A student based on his / her performance and interest can choose either one on both. Successful completion of 
minor area credits and / or departmental Specialization will be indicated on the degree.
When a student opts for a departmental specialization and / or a minor area, he / she can use 10 open category 
credits (mandatory degree requirement) towards departmental specialization and/or minor area requirements. For 
example, a student registered for B.Tech. (Chemical Engineering) and opting for minor area in Computer Science 
and Engineering, can opt for courses prescribed for minor area in Computer Science and Engineering, as part of 
mandatory 10 credits requirements under OC. He / she will need to do additional 10 credits in the minor area to be 
eligible for Minor area specialization in the degree.
A student may not opt for either of the two but can do additional credits through open choice of courses. In case 
a student cannot meet requirements of a minor area or departmental Specialization, additional credits earned by 
the student over and above his / her degree requirement will be used for DGPA calculation and will be indicated 
on his / her transcript.
A set of pre-defined courses of total 20 credits in a focus area comprises a Departmental Specialization if the 
courses belong to the parent Department of an undergraduate programme, or a Minor / Interdisciplinary Area 
Specialization if the courses belong to a different Department / Centre / School. Additional conditions and details of 
individual specializations are given in Section 7.
If any course of a Minor / Interdisciplinary area overlaps with any core course (DC or PC category courses) or 
elective course (DE or PE category courses) of the studentâs programme, then credits from this course will not count 
towards the minor area credit requirements, though this course may contribute towards satisfying the requirement 
of the Minor / Interdisciplinary area. In such a case, the requirement of 20 credits must be completed by taking 
other courses of the specialization.
The maximum number of credits per semester may be relaxed upto 28 by Dean, Acaemics for those students who 
apply for capability-linked option through proper channel.
4.9 Change of Programme at the End of the First Year
(a) 
An undergraduate (B.Tech. / Dual Degree) student is eligible to apply for change of branch at the end of the 
first year only, provided he / she satisfies the following criteria:

M.Tech., M.S. (Research), M.P.P., Ph.D. degrees and P.G. D.I.I.T. are listed in Table 11. Failure to maintain the 
specified academic standing will result in termination of registration and the studentâs name will be struck off the rolls.
The maximum permitted duration of each programme will be determined in terms of the number of registered 
semesters. Any semester in which a student has registered for a course will be called a registered semester subject 
to the following:
(a) Only the 1st and 2nd semesters of an academic year can be registered semesters. The summer semester 
will not be considered as a registered semester.
(b) A semester when a student has been granted semester withdrawal or granted leave will not be considered 
as a registered semester.
(c) The semester when a student is suspended from the Institute on disciplinary grounds will not be counted 
towards the number of registered semesters. 
The summer semesters falling in between the permitted registered semesters shall be available for earning credits. 
After the student has registered for the maximum permissible number of registered semesters, the subsequent 
summer semesters will not be available for earning credits.
5.3 Minimum Student Registration for a Programme
M.Sc., M.B.A., M.Des., M.P.P. or M.Tech. programme will not be run unless the number of students registered for 
that programme is six or more. If the number of students left in a programme at the end of the 2nd semester is 
less than four, the same programme may be looked into for temporary suspension by the Board of Educational 
Research and Planning.
5.4 Lower and Upper Limits for Credits Registered
For students pursuing M.Sc., M.B.A., M.Tech., M.P.P. and M.S.(Research), the minimum registration requirements

M.Tech. or equivalent degree holders admitted to Ph.D. are required to complete a minimum of 6 credits. The 
Departments  / Centres / Schools may stipulate a larger number of credits in general or in specific cases. The 
course requirement will be determined by the Department / Centre / School Research Committee (DRC / CRC / SRC) 
on the recommendations of the supervisor after due consideration of the background of the student in relation 
to the proposed topic of research. These courses can be prescribed from existing M.Tech. courses and / or 
from special pre-Ph.D. courses including laboratory, seminar, foreign language, etc. Normally, no independent 
study course will be allowed for Ph.D. students. The pre-Ph.D. course credits that contribute to the DGPA of the 
Research Scholar can only be earned from regular lecture courses. In exceptional cases for Research Scholars 
who join the Ph.D. programme after B.Tech. (or equivalent) degree, a maximum of one course may be allowed 
having laboratory or programming content only. Such an exception would be allowed by the Dean, Academics 
on recommendation of the SRC of the student and the corresponding DRC / CRC.
Further, in case a Ph.D. student having completed 15 credits is unable to complete the research at the Ph.D. 
level for any reason whatsoever, he / she may be allowed to complete M.S. (Research) degree requirement as 
per Institute rules.
A student shall be formally registered / admitted to the candidacy of Ph.D. degree only after he / she has cleared 
the comprehensive examination. Students would be permitted to take the comprehensive examination only after 
they have submitted a research plan and have completed the course work (including compulsory audit course - 
HSL 800: Research Writing). Full-time and part-time students must clear the comprehensive examination within a 
period of 18 months and 24 months, respectively, from the date of joining. A maximum of two chances will be given 
to any student to clear the comprehensive examination. Every student, after having completed the comprehensive 
examination must formally register for the candidacy on a form obtainable from the Academic Section.

(a) 
Leave during course work
A full-time Ph.D. student, during his/her stay at the Institute will be entitled to leave for 30 days, including leave 
on medical grounds, per academic year. Even during mid-semester breaks, and summer and winter vacations,  
he/she will have to explicitly apply for leave. He / she, however, may be permitted to avail of leave only up to 15 
days during winter vacation at the end of the first semester.
Leave beyond 30 days in an academic year may be granted to a research scholar in exceptional cases subject to 
the following conditions:
(i) 
the leave beyond 30 days will be without Assistantship / Scholarship, and
(ii) 
such an extension of up to additional 30 days will be granted only once during the programme of the scholar.
In addition, a Ph.D. student who has completed his / her course work may be granted leave on medical grounds 
up to 10 days per academic year.
Women research scholars will be eligible for Maternity Leave with assistantship for a period not exceeding 180 
days once during the tenure of their Ph.D. programme.

5.13.4 Attendance requirements for assistantship
Any full time Ph.D. student receiving assistantship or scholarship irrespective of the source while pursuing course 
work, must attend at least 75% of classes in each course in which he / she is registered. In case his / her attendance 
falls below 75% in any course during a month, he / she will not be paid assistantship for that month. Further, if his / her 
attendance again falls short of 75% in any course in any subsequent month in that semester, his / her studentship 
and assistantship will be terminated. A research scholar after having completed the course work must attend to 
his / her research work on all the working days and mark attendance except when he / she is on duly sanctioned 
leave. The requirement of 75% attendance will apply as above, on daily attendance except in the cases where 
longer leave has been duly sanctioned within the leave entitlement of the student. For the above purpose, if 75% 
works out to be a number which is not a whole number, the immediate lower whole number will be treated as the 
required 75% attendance.
All scholars who are offered assistantship are expected to put in 8 hours per week towards the work assigned by 
the Institute. Continuation of assistantship in the subsequent semester would be conditional, subject to satisfactory 
performance in the work assigned.
The above holds for Prime Ministerâs Research Fellowship (PMRF) scholars as well. Additional rules governing 
PMRF scholars may be announced from time to time.
5.13.5 Further regulations governing Ph.D. students
The Ph.D. degree of the Institute may be conferred on a candidate who fulfills all the requirements detailed in the 
Ordinances and other rules, approved by the Senate. Some of the important regulations are given below:
(i) 
Applications for Ph.D. registration, i.e., for entry to a course of study and research leading to Ph.D. 
degree must be made to the Board of Academic Programmes (BAP) on the approved form. The date 
of registration is normally the date of joining the programme. However, in exceptional cases the date of 
registration may be preponed by a maximum of 6 months by the BAP if it is convinced that the candidate 
has spent adequate amount of time on research earlier.
(ii) 
The academic programme of all the Ph.D. candidates in a Department/Centre/School will be coordinated 
by the DRC / CRC / SRC appointed by the BAP.
(iii) The supervisor shall be a full-time member of the academic staff of the Institute. The supervisor(s) shall 
be appointed within three months of joining the programme. For this, Ph.D. candidates must fill up the 
required portion of the prescribed form, following which supervisor(s) must fill up the required portion, 
and the Student Research Committee (SRC) must be finalized by the respective DRC / CRC / SRC, of 
the Academic Unit. This process must be completed within three months of the Ph.D. candidate's date 
of first registration. If necessary, the Board of Academic Programme on the recommendations of the 
Supervisor through the DRC / CRC / SRC, may appoint Joint Supervisor(s) not exceeding two from inside 
or outside the Institute. Normally, there should not be more than two supervisors for a candidate from 
within the Institute. Appointment of any Joint Supervisor would not be permitted after a lapse of eighteen 
months from the date of registration of the candidate, except in cases when none of the supervisors is 
in the Institute for a year or more at a stretch.
(iv) The DRC / CRC / SRC shall meet from time to time and review the progress of each candidate in the course 
work, as well as research, by any means, including oral examination of the candidate, if necessary, and 
recommend, after due consultation with the supervisor(s), such steps to the candidate as are necessary 
to improve his / her performance.
(v) 
The progress of each candidate will be monitored by the DRC /CRC/SRC. For this purpose, the following 
procedures will be followed:
(a) 
Ph.D. research work will be compulsorily given a course number, DTD 899 (Doctoral Thesis) for 
all candidates across the Institute.
(b) 
The DRC / CRC / SRC Secretary / Ph.D. Coordinator will be coordinating the collection of progress 
reports written and signed by the scholars and forwarded by the supervisors every semester.
(c) 
The supervisor(s) / SRC / DRC / CRC will evaluate the progress of the student every semester.
(d) 
Xâ grade will be awarded if the progress is âsatisfactoryâ in that semester.
(e) 
If the progress is âunsatisfactoryâ, âUâ grade  will be awarded. For the first appearance of âUâ grade, 
a warning would be issued to the candidate by Dean, Academics. If his / her performance does not 
improve after warning, the assistantship may be withheld.

(f) 
If there are two consecutive âUâ grade (in consecutive semesters), the registration will stand 
terminated.
(g) 
Submission of progress report should continue till submission of thesis.
(h) 
Like all other courses, the grades for DTD 899 will be discussed in the Department / Centre / School 
as per the semester schedule.
  
The above process will continue till the thesis is submitted.
(vi) The candidate may submit the thesis at any time provided that:
(a) 
He / she has completed the minimum period of registration including any extension prescribed by 
the Board of Academic Programmes (BAP).
(b) 
He / she has completed the course work requirement as prescribed by the DRC / CRC / SRC with 
DGPA not below 7.50 and has also cleared the comprehensive examination.
(c) 
He / she has submitted at least two months in advance, the title and a synopsis of the thesis. The 
Synopsis along with the list of examiners suggested by the supervisor needs to be approved by 
the DRC / CRC / SRC and then forwarded to Dean, Academics.
(vii) The thesis shall normally be written in English in the specific format and shall contain a critical account 
of the candidateâs research. It should be characterized by a discovery of facts, a fresh approach towards 
interpretation of facts and theories or significant contribution to knowledge of design or development, or 
a combination of them. It should bear evidence of the candidateâs capacity for analysis and judgement 
and also his/her ability to carry out independent investigation, design or development. A thesis should 
normally be supplemented by published work. No part of the thesis or supplementary published work 
shall be submitted for the award of any other Degree / Diploma. Normally, three copies of thesis in soft 
cover have to be submitted in the format prescribed by the Institute. In case of joint supervision, four 
copies of the thesis are required to be submitted.
(viii) On receipt of the title and synopsis of a thesis, the Dean, Academics will appoint a Board of Examiners 
for each candidate. The Board will consist of one (or two) internal examiner(s), normally the supervisor(s), 
and two external examiners, one from within India and one from abroad who shall be an expert in the 
subject of thesis. These external examiners shall be chosen from a list of eight, to be recommended by 
the supervisor(s) through the DRC/CRC/SRC while forwarding the title and synopsis of the thesis. The 
candidate will be required to submit a fresh synopsis if more than 9 months elapse from the synopsis 
submission date to the thesis submission date.
(ix) Each Examiner will submit a detailed assessment report recommending to the BAP, one of the following 
courses of action:
(a) 
that the thesis be deemed satisfactory and that the candidate may defend his/her thesis orally 
before a committee constituted for the purpose and any members of the faculty and research 
students who wish to be present.
(b) 
that the candidate may submit a revised thesis before the expiry of a specific period. In the normal 
circumstances, he / she may submit the revised thesis within a period of one year from the date of 
communication in this regard from the Dean, Academics. However, in exceptional circumstances, 
this period may be extended by the BAP by another year: the total revision time irrespective of the 
number of revisions allowed will not exceed a period of two years.
(c) 
that the thesis be rejected outright.
  
In the event of disagreement between the external examiners, the BAP may, as a special case, 
appoint another external examiner, if the merit of the case so demands. The examiner will report 
independently to the BAP.
(x) 
The oral defense of the thesis shall be conducted by a committee consisting of the internal examiner(s) 
and one external examiner. If none of the external examiners is available for the conduct of the oral 
defense, an alternative external examiner shall be appointed by the BAP for this purpose only.
(xi) On the completion of all stages of the examination, the Oral Defense Committee shall recommend to 
the BAP one of the following courses of action:

is for the Department / Centre / School Library and the other is for the Central Library. A softcopy 
of the thesis has been submitted to the Central Library.
(d) 
A Hindi translation of the thesis abstract is to be submitted as part of final submission (after examiner 
reports are received). The students can seek assistance from Hindi Cell in this regard.
(xiii) If a member of the academic staff, who is registered for the degree, leaves the Institute before the 
minimum period of registration is completed, he / she will be permitted to submit his thesis in due course, 
provided that:
(a) 
a substantial part of the research has been completed at the Institute; and
(b) 
any additional work required can be adequately supervised.
(xiv) A member of the academic staff who has commenced his research before joining the Institute may, at

7.  CAPABILITY-LINKED OPTIONS FOR  
UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS
As described in Section 4.8, students can make use of additional credits in two blocks of 20 credits to opt for
 
(a) 
Minor/Interdisciplinary Area Specialization
 
(b) 
Departmental Specialization
A student based on his / her performance and interest can choose either one on both. Successful completion of 
minor area credits and / or Interdisciplinary / Departmental Specialization will be indicated on the degree.
When a student opts for such a specialization and / or a minor area, he / she can use 10 open category (OC) credits 
(mandatory degree requirement) towards the specialization and/or minor area requirements. For example, a student 
registered for B.Tech (Chemical Engg.) and opting for minor area in Computer Science, can opt for courses prescribed 
for the minor area, as part of mandatory 10 credits requirements under OC. He/she will need to do additional 10 
credits for completing the Minor area requirements.
A set of pre-defined courses of total 20 credits in a focus area comprises a Departmental Specialization if the 
courses belong to the parent Department of an undergraduate programme, or a Minor / Interdisciplinary Area 
Specialization if the courses belong to a different Department / Centre / School. Additional conditions and details 
are given in this section.
If any course of a Minor / Interdisciplinary area overlaps with any core course (DC or PC category courses) or elective 
course (DE or PE category courses) of the studentâs programme, then credits from this course will not count towards 
the minor area credit requirements, though this course may contribute towards satisfying the requirement of the 
Minor / Interdisciplinary area. In such a case, the requirement of 20 credits must be completed by taking other courses 
of the Minor Area or Departmental / Interdisciplinary specialization. A student interested in opting for a Capability-
linked option can register for the same online, on a first-come first served basis, after he / she completes at least 
2 courses, preferably the core courses (wherever applicable) of the Minor Area / Interdisciplinary / Departmental 
Specialization being applied for.
The maximum number of credits per semester may be relaxed upto 28 by Dean, Acaemics for those students who 
apply for capability-linked option through proper channel.

8.  NON-GRADED CORE FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS
In order to synergize formal academics with informal outside-class-room learning experience, mechanisms for 
earning non-graded units have been introduced in the undergraduate curriculum in 2013. In order to earn these 
units, a student will need to involve himself / herself in activities beyond the classroom engagements. For earning 
1 unit a student will typically need to work for 2-3 hours per week (28-42 hours per semester) in on-campus 
activities. In case of project/design / internship activities, the student engagement expected is typically 20 days 
of work per non-graded unit. A student would not be allowed to earn credits as well as non-graded units for the 
same effort. It is important that the efforts towards earning non-graded units should be distinct from that spent 
on earning credits. Also, the effort for earning different components of the non-graded units should be distinct, 
i.e., the same effort would not be evaluated for more than one non-graded component.
Non-graded core of the undergraduate curriculum comprises of the following components:

These 11 units form a compulsory graduation requirement for all the undergraduate (B.Tech. as well as Dual 
degree) programmes. A student will need to earn these 11 units over the duration of the programme with special 
consideration and requirements for each component as detailed in the following sections. Each component 
would be constituted by one or more non-graded courses, and a student will need to get an âSâ grade in these 
courses to earn the respective non-graded unit(s). Incomplete status in such courses will be indicated by a âZâ 
grade. The student would be required either to repeat the course/activity or continue with the project/internship 
until such time that the evaluating faculty member/committee is satisfied with the effort to award an âSâ grade. 
No partial/ fractional units can be awarded. For example, if a particular activity carries 2 units, a student cannot 
be awarded 1 unit or fractional units for incomplete work, but would need to repeat / complete the work to the 
satisfaction of the evaluating faculty member/committee to become eligible for award of 2 units.
For components 3-6 in the above table, a special portal called the NGU portal is used for necessary approvals 
and posting of âSâ grades. This portal can be accessed at https://ngu.iitd.ac.in/index
8.1 Introduction to Engineering and Programme
This non-graded component is aimed at orienting and exciting students in the subject of engineering in general 
and their respective disciplines in particular. The objectives of the component are:
â¢ 
Exposing students to âEngineeringâ as a profession that creates wealth for nations, and as a vehicle 
for economic growth.
â¢ 
Exposing students to Science / Engineering as a medium through which one can address problems 
facing the society including some of the grand challenges.
â¢ 
Excite students by enabling them to appreciate the role and enormous impact of research in science/ 
engineering on our day to day lives.
â¢ 
Enlighten students about the various career options available to them.
â¢ 
Make students aware of the issues involved in engineering a product, and help them appreciate why 
the process of design and innovation leading to products and systems is both personally satisfying 
and professionally rewarding.
â¢ 
Excite students about potential role models and successful alumni in engineering profession.
â¢ 
Motivate students to take up some co-curricular activities on their own during their stay in the Institute.
The activities to realize the above-mentioned objectives as part of this non-graded component include:

â¢ 
Lectures by faculty, visitors, alumni on some exciting topics.
This non-graded unit is administered in the form of one non-graded course of one unit:
â¢ 
NIN100 Introduction to Engineering and Programme in the first semester of the undergraduate 
programme.
The course coordinator of NIN100 would be identified by the Dean Academics. Apart from the main coordinator, 
each department offering a UG programme, will identify a departmental coordinator for this course. The 
departmental coordinator will engage with students of their respective departments and will cover 30-35% of 
the course.
It is necessary to  get a satisfactory (S) grade in this course for completing the degree requirements. Attendance 
would be one of the main criteria for evaluation. Apart from this, active participation and quiz-based evaluation 
etc. would also be used as a basis to decide âSâ or âZâ grade. The grades of NIN100 would be moderated by 
Dean Academics
8.2 Language and Writing Skills
All students are required to participate in Task-Based language classes in the first two semesters. The language 
needs of a particular batch of the students will be assessed through an online test before the classes begin in the 
first semester. Then the exercises for different classes will be tailored to the language needs of those students. 
In general, these exercises are designed to enhance linguistic capabilities in comprehension, both reading and 
listening, as well as improve the ability to structure and compose ideas in spoken and written communication. Many 
of them will be structured in the form of competitive games. Wherever necessary principles of English Grammar will 
be discussed along with the nuances of technical writing. With respect to its content, some of the textual material 
and lectures   will focus on the relationship between Engineering, Humanities and Social Sciences.
The two semesters of Language and Writing Skills is administered in the form of two courses, each of one unit: 
NLN100 Language and Writing SkillsâI in the first semester and NLN101 Language and Writing SkillsâII in the 
second semester. These courses are coordinated by faculty from the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences 
and an S grade in both NLN100 and NLN101 is generally a prerequisite to register for most undergraduate courses 
offered by the department of HSS. Assessment of a student towards S grade in each of these courses would 
typically be on the basis of attendance, participation and performance in the exercises. A student could also be 
prescribed self-learning exercises or additional practice sessions during vacations as requirement for securing S 
grade. Studentâs involvement, during regular semester, would typically be two hours per week. The grades of these 
courses are moderated by the Dean Academics.
8.3 NCC/ NSO/ NSS
A student is required to choose one of NCC/NSO/NSS during the first semester, and complete the requirements 
preferably within the first four registered semesters. Students will be required to earn a minimum of 1 non-graded 
unit from one of these activities, by completing at least 40 hours of work. Students can earn upto 2 units by putting 
in 80 hours of work. The faculty coordinators of NCC / NSO / NSS decide and announce the  policies on earning 
non-graded units in these activities from time to time.

8.4 Professional Ethics and Social Responsibility
There is increasing consensus worldwide that engineering ethics should be incorporated into the engineering 
curriculum to provide students with an exposure to the kind of professional ethical dilemmas they might face on 
an individual basis as well as in the larger context of ethical aspects of technology development. Workshops, 
discussion/ debates, use of theatre-in-education, case-study based approaches, etc. are often used for illustration 
and discussion of engineering ethics. Such inputs could be provided in a stand-alone manner, integrated into 
existing courses or both. The objective of this non-graded component is to sensitize students about Professional 
Ethics and Social Responsibility (PESR) through a combination of the above-mentioned approaches, supplemented 
by discussion fora and supplementary materials, to help students to become ethical professionals. A student 
is required to complete minimum of 1 non-graded unit in this component through activities divided into 3 core 
courses. The courses NEN100 and NEN101 together correspond to 0.5 non-graded unit and the course NEN300 
also corresponds to 0.5 unit. Besides, the students can earn an additional unit through one of the two alternatives 
NEN202/NEN203 as discussed below. Thus, the courses under PESR are:
i) 
NEN100 Professional Ethics and Social Responsibility â I (core)
ii) NEN101 Professional Ethics and Social Responsibility â II (core)
iii) One of the following two courses: (optional)
  a. NEN202 PESR Workshops
  b. NEN203 PESR Projects
iv) NEN300 Case Studies in Professional Ethics (core)
Core Requirements
NEN100 and NEN101 are compulsory for all students, and these courses involve interactive sessions of a group 
of students with a resource person in the first and second semesters respectively. The student will earn 0.5 unit 
by getting S grade in both these courses.
In NEN300 Case Studies in Professional Ethics, every student will work on at least two case studies related to 
professional ethics, followed by discussions  on the same, moderated by a resource person. The details on how 
to select the case studies and the mode of discussions and their evaluation would be decided by the concerned 
resource person. The student will earn 0.5 unit by getting an S grade in this course.
Activities for Additional NGU
The students can choose to earn 1 more NGU under PESR by participating in any one out of a large variety of 
activities relevant to the core themes of PESR. With the considerable amount of flexibility  allowed in the choice 
of activities, each student desirous of earning this unit should be able to identify an activity of interest to him / her 
under the purview of PESR. These activities have been divided into two broad categories, viz., (a) PESR workshops 
(b) PESR projects, each of which corresponds to a separate course number NEN202 and NEN203 respectively. 
After a student has got âSâ grades in NEN100 and NEN101, the student can register for NEN / 202 / NEN203.  
âSâ grade in any of these two courses will get the student 1 NGU.
NEN202 PESR Workshops
Under NEN202 (PESR Workshops), students can participate in one workshop of 5 days duration if the workshop is 
held in person. These workshops are generally organized on campus by NRCVEE soon after major examinations 
at the end of every semester. Alternatively, online workshops can be held with about 40 hours of engagement 
through 2-3 hour sessions during the semester or during vacation period. These workshops are organized by 
NRCVEE and would be conducted by resource persons from within or outside the Institute. These workshops could 
be pertaining to any of the themes relevant to PESR and the in-person ones could be held during mid-semester 
break / summer / winter vacation. The students must follow the procedure announced by the faculty  coordinator 
to register for a workshop. The âSâ grade for attending a workshop will be awarded only if the student  attends all 
sessions of the workshop on all the days for its full duration.
NEN203 PESR Projects
Under NEN203 (PESR Projects), the students can take up projects under the guidance of one or more faculty 
members to make positive contribution to campus life. This could include promoting wholesome practices on 
campus such as:

Text on page:99
Courses of Study 2023-2024
94
â¢ 
ethical practices particularly among students through specially directed efforts;
â¢ 
peer assistance for the students in need of help academically or otherwise;
â¢ 
sustainable practices on campus like resource conservation, waste management, use of renewable  
 
 
resources and the like;
â¢ 
working on technology for a social cause etc.
This work could be done during a semester or mid-semester break or summer / winter vacation. The student 
must submit a project proposal on the NGU portal, with explicit statement of deliverables, through his / her faculty 
supervisor(s), for approval  by the PESR coordinator. If the work is taken up in a team, each studentâs share of 
work must be defined in the proposal. It is expected that each student puts in at least 40 hours of effort in the 
project. On completion of the project, the students should submit a completion request online along with a report 
of the work done, again through the faculty supervisor, who should certify that each student has completed his / her 
share of the deliverables and each student has put in at least 40 hours of work into the project.
If a student gets selected in one of the nation building initiatives organized by reputed organizations, the student 
can identify a faculty supervisor who can be informed of the work done as part of these initiatives. On successful 
completion of the work, the student can apply on the NGU portal for earning NEN203 units through the faculty 
supervisor, who can certify the completion of the concerned activity.

8.5 Communication Skills / Seminar
The objective of this non-graded component is to provide the students with an opportunity to develop their skills 
in preparing write-ups, making presentations, and reading / listening to othersâ write-ups / presentations. A student 
would be required to earn 1 non-graded unit under this component between  5th and 8th semesters through any 
of the following:
(i) 
 Attending one of the topic specific seminar courses (XXQ301, XXQ302, etc.) introduced by the parent 
Department of a student (for example ELQ301 â Seminar on Embedded Systems â 1 unit) or attending 
a seminar course (XYQ301, XYQ302 etc.) offered by any other Department / Centre / School. These 
courses would be non-credit electives, offered in each semester. These seminar sessions would be 
held for two hours per week. Many such courses could run in parallel.
(ii) Participating in optional seminars which may be part of regular courses; for example regular  âLâ courses 
can have an optional seminar component (e.g. ELL711 Optical Communications can have optional 
seminar component of 1 unit). This would, like any other seminar course, need to have seminar sessions 
of 2 hours duration every week for a whole semester. In such a case, a student should register for 
XXQ30y, and the course coordinator would send recommendations for âSâ grades to the Dean Academics, 
duly moderated by the Moderation Committee of the concerned Department / Centre / School.
(iii) By participating in special workshops on Communication Skills approved by Dean Academics. The 
faculty coordinator in charge of the workshop would submit a list of students who completed the activity 
with 100% attendance in all sessions on all days of the workshop for award of âSâ grade in NQN301.
(iv)  By submitting documentary evidence of excellence in debating and / or writing as certified by faculty 
in-charge of these activities, to the Dean, Academics. In all such cases, the student should submit 
documentary evidence online, as detailed below:
 
â¢ 
A student who wins first, second or third position in any event / competition conducted at inter-hostel 
level, by BRCA or by BSP or by BSW would qualify for this option. The event / competition must 

Text on page:101
Courses of Study 2023-2024
96
be either a debate / declamation / extempore. Since many such events do not have certificates 
issued, the student must submit a letter signed by the warden or the president of the respective 
board (in case of BRCA, president of the club would also suffice) stating the date, time, venue 
of the event / competition along with the number of participants and position secured. In case 
number of participants is less than 20, the event shall not be counted.
 
â¢ 
A student who performs as a compere for any of the Institute functions (only those listed in the 
Institute calendar). The student will need to produce a signed letter from the faculty in-charge 
of the Institute function stating the studentâs role as compere. The letter must include the date, 
time, venue and duration of the event. Any event lasting less than 1 hour will not be counted.
 
â¢ 
A student winning a technical paper presentation award during TRYST will need to submit a copy 
of the certificate and the abstract of the paper presented. Technical publications in Journals or 
Conferences would also be considered, provided (i) the number of authors of the paper does not 
exceed 2 and (ii) the faculty member supervising the work certifies that the paper was written by 
the concerned student.
A minimum of three such documents certified by the faculty in charge of the Board / Club / Activity as mentioned above 
would qualify a student to earn one unit of Communication Skills / Seminar. In each case, before recommending the 
award of non-graded units for the above activities, the faculty in charge of the Board / Club / Activity should keep in 
mind that a student engagement / effort (including preparations and the actual event) of about 40 hours would be 
necessary for the award of one non-graded unit.
In cases of options (i), and (ii) above, the faculty member in charge of the course should ensure that the student 
has 100% attendance in the seminars and has done a satisfactory task of his / her contribution to the course: the 
write-up, presentation, etc. before awarding an âSâ grade. These grades would be moderated by the respective 
Department / Centre / School. In case of unavoidable absence of up to 3 seminar sessions, appropriate compensation 
mechanism should be announced by the faculty member at the beginning of the course. For absence beyond 3 
sessions, S grade cannot be awarded.
An Institute level Coordinator for Communication Skills / Seminar, appointed by the Dean Academics, would serve 
as the course coordinator of NQN301. An Institute level committee would moderate the non-graded units for 
Communication Skills / Seminar recommended for activities other than the courses XXQ30y.
8.6 Design / Practical Experience
The objective of this non-graded component is to give opportunities to students to learn in an informal setting. 
This mode of learning, is often more effective than conventional lectures / laboratory work. Second and even 
more important objective of this non-graded component is to inculcate design thinking among students and 
facilitate them to gain some design immersion experience. Design / Practical Experience (DPE) component can 
promote learning by doing which does two important things: Firstly, it allows students to immerse themselves 
in the environment in which work is to be done, so that they can understand the values and expectations of the 
target beneficiaries. Secondly it enables a fresh look at problems, not only at the ways of defining them, but also 
at the ways to solve those including skill-sets that are required to address them. This approach signifies a shift 
from problem based  learning (acquisition of knowledge) to project based learning (application of knowledge), 
in which the projects are grounded in problems outside the classrooms and laboratories, in everyday scenarios. 
Thus, DPE bridges division between the curricular and the co-curricular components, and encourages the curiosity 
and involvement that arises from total absorption in a subject of interest.
As a part of this requirement, every student is expected to earn a minimum of three non-graded units of DPE to 
complete the degree requirements. To earn one unit of DPE, a student is expected to put in 28-42 hours of effort 
or 20 working days depending on the type of activity. To earn two units of DPE, a student needs to put in 56-84 
hours of effort or 40 working days depending on the nature of activity. These units can be earned in multiple 
ways during the semester as well as during vacation and mid-semester breaks:
â¢ 
Courses with design focus without any regular graded credits, which are designated to give design /  
practical experience units.
â¢ 
Courses (core or elective) with optional design / practical experience component.
â¢ 
Summer / semester internships by students in R&D / Industry / Universities in India or abroad.

â¢ 
Summer / winter / semester projects under the guidance of faculty of the Institute.
â¢ 
 Participation in design /innovation projects by Innovation Center / CAIC, etc.
â¢ 
 One time activity such as design /practical experience workshop /course /event during semester / 
vacation /mid-semester breaks, etc.
DPE activities are not restricted to design of physical products but can also include system level design and 
experience. For example a team of students who under the supervision of faculty in collaboration with an NGO, 
would like to design a new financial inclusion system for marginalized section of population too can earn design /
practical experience units.
The operational modalities of implementing the above-mentioned activities so that students can earn the required 
non-graded units, are presented in the following paragraphs.
8.6.1 Management of Non-graded DPE Units
Each Department offering UG programme(s) would constitute a DPE Committee with a Departmental DPE 
Coordinator to manage the non-graded Design /Practical Experience units.
a) 
 The Departmental DPE Committee would coordinate with Office of Career Services (OCS) to identify 
and vet industries for internships.
b) 
 The committee would also examine other types of internships (in Universities, research laboratories, 
start-ups etc.) requested by students and approve or deny as per a policy defined by the Department.
c) 
 Students of the Department desirous of earning non-graded DPE units through any other mechanism 
listed above should request permission of this committee before embarking on the activity. The 
committee would also decide on the award of non-graded DPE units for all such activities for the 
students of the Department through appropriate evaluation mechanisms.
d) 
 The committee would be responsible to evaluate the design activities carried out by the students during 
internships and recommending award of the non-graded DPE units, or continuation of the internship 
activity for more days to become eligible for the units, as per the efforts of the students during the 
internship. DPE Committee will moderate all Design units awarded to students of that Department. The 
Departmental DPE Coordinator also has responsibility of ensuring that units earned by heterogeneous 
activities meet the requirements in terms of learning efforts and experience.
e) The Dean Academics will appoint an Institute DPE Coordinator for Design / Practical Experience 
 units.
f) 
Departmental DPE Coordinators, Institute DPE Coordinator and Associate Dean Academics-
Curriculum together will form an institute level committee to moderate the non-graded units awarded 
under interdisciplinary work including the activities carried out by students in Departments / Centers / 
Schools not offering UG programmes. This committee would also review and modify policies as well 
as modalities for  administering DPE units.
8.6.2 Activities Covered Under Design / Practical Experience
8.6.2.1 Specialized Courses Related to Design / Practical Experience (Maximum 2 Units)
Departments / Centres / Schools may offer a basket of courses that will not have any credits associated with them 
but will have only Design / Practical Experience units linked to them. In other words, on successful completion of 
such courses the students will earn only DPE units but no graded credits. These courses offered by Departments / 
Centers / Schools can be of one unit (28-42 hours of student effort) or two units (56-84 hours of student effort). 
Faculty offering these courses will award these units on successful completion of the course requirements, 
and the same would be moderated by the Departmental Committee for DPE in case of Departments offering 
undergraduate programmes. For other Departments / Centres / Schools, the moderation would be done by the 
Institute level DPE committee.
8.6.2.2 Semester / Summer / Winter Projects Under the Guidance of Institute Faculty (Maximum 2 Units)
Some of the co-curricular activities in the Institute that pertain to team based product building such as Robotics, 
Automobile, IGEM, Aero-modelling etc. can also be considered for earning DPE units. Students who successfully 
complete SURA / DISA projects will also be eligible for DPE units. Besides, students may also opt for working on 

Text on page:103
Courses of Study 2023-2024
98
semester / summer / winter projects involving design/practical experience activity under the guidance of faculty 
of the institute. In order to be evaluated for DPE Units in such cases, a student should register for XXD35y Minor 
Design Project floated by the parent Department XX of the student. In case the project is interdisciplinary or it 
is offered by faculty of other Departments / Centres / Schools, the faculty supervisor of the project may advise 
the students to register for NDN35y Minor Design Project. In either case, the project would be evaluated by 
the faculty supervisor.
The courses XXD351 â XXD355 would be Minor Design Projects with 1 non-graded DPE unit, and XXD356 
â XXD358 would be Minor Design Projects with 2 non-graded units each. Courses NDN351 â 358 would also 
follow a similar definition.
8.6.2.3 Regular Courses with Optional Design / Practical Experience Component (Maximum 2 Units)
Course coordinators of regular core and elective courses can also offer optional design component in their 
courses. A proposal for this should be sent to the Departmental DPE committee prior to the commencement of the 
course by the Course Coordinator. This would be notified to students by the Departmental DPE committee and 
also announced to the students by the course coordinator. Successful completion of the course will give graded 
credits to students and at the same time they will be eligible for earning (1 or 2) design units if they successfully 
complete the optional DPE component. The course coordinator will recommend these DPE units on successful 
completion of the assigned work. This would be moderated by the Departmental Committee for DPE. In case the 
course is offered by Departments / Centres / Schools which do not offer a UG programme, the notification prior 
to beginning of the course and moderation after the end of the course would be done by the Institute level DPE 
committee. In order to be evaluated for DPE Units, a student should register for XXD35y Minor Design Project 
or NDN35y Minor Design Project as the case may be.
8.6.2.4 Summer Internships (Maximum 2 Units)
Students can undertake a minimum of 40 working days of internship to earn two design practical experience units 
during summer vacations in Industry, R&D institutions or Universities in India or abroad. This cannot be earned in 
parts. For example, 1 NGU cannot be claimed for 20 working days of internship. This would be administered by 
the Departmental Committee for DPE with the help of the Office of Carrer Services (OCS). Students are required 
to get approval for taking up internship in the concerned Institute through the NGU portal prior to proceeding 
for the internship if they wish to claim NGU for the internship. The Departmental DPE Committee would also be 
responsible for appointing a faculty supervisor for the internship. Students can proceed with the internship after 
the Departmental Committee for DPE approves the same. Design units for the internship would be awarded by 
the Departmental Committee after evaluation at the end of internship period. Rules governing administration of 
internships are given in section 8.6.3. In case an internship pertains to areas of expertise outside those of the 
parent Department, the DPE Committee may co-opt faculty members from other Departments / Centres / Schools 
for evaluating / supervising such internships.
8.6.2.5 One-Semester Internship (Maximum 5 Units)
Students can opt for one semester internship in Industry, R&D institutions or Universities in India or abroad, for 
a minimum of 100 working days, by appropriately planning for completion of credit requirements for the degree. 
The student can also opt for a break in coursework for a semester to initiate or work for his / her start up. These 
are the only two activities upon successful completion of which students would be eligible for 5 DPE units. It is 
mandatory that studentâs work during the one-semester internship is supervised by two mentors, one from the 
institute (appointed by the DPE Committee of the studentâs Department) and another from the host organization. 
In case of semester break for a start-up, students will work under the mentorship of a faculty member of the 
Institute. Students desiring to opt for one semester internship or semester break for start-up as mentioned 
above are required to plan well in advance and submit a project proposal in consultation with their supervisors 
(in case of internship) or faculty mentor (in case of start-ups). Students can proceed with the internship / startup 
activity only after the Departmental Committee for DPE approves the same. DPE units for the activity would 
be awarded by the Departmental DPE Committee after evaluation at the end of the internship / startup period. 
In case an internship / startup pertains to areas of expertise outside those of the parent Department, the DPE 
Committee may co-opt faculty members from other Departments / Centres / Schools for evaluating / supervising 
such activities. Details of the procedure are given in section 8.6.3 on internships.
A semester in which a student earns DPE units through semester-long internship or start-up as discussed above 
would be counted as a registered semester for graduation requirements. In case the DPE committee does not 
approve the award of 5 units for such activity, the semester would not be counted as a registered semester.

8.6.2.6 One Time Design / Practical Experience Module (1 Unit)
One time DPE modules can be offered by Institute faculty as well as working professionals who would like to 
engage students in a workshop / course related to design / practical experience. A proposal for such a module 
should be sent by faculty member coordinating the course through the concerned Department / Centre / School 
to the Institute DPE Committee for approval. These modules can be typically of 28-42 hours duration, and 
may be offered during mid-semester breaks, winter / summer vacations and even during non-class hours 
in the semester.

â¢ 
 A student cannot register for more than 3 non-graded DPE units per summer semester or per registered 
semester in which a student is on regular academic activity. To take part in activities that can result in 
more than 3 DPE units, a student has to take the semester off from regular courses.
â¢ 
 A single activity cannot be evaluated for more than one purpose. For example, the same project cannot 
be submitted for graded credits as well as for design units.
8.6.3 Rules Governing Internship
i) 
 Internships for DPE units are permitted only in one of the two following formats:
 
a. 
Summer internship of 40 days duration, in which a student can earn 2 DPE units.
 
b. 
Semester-long internship of 100 days duration, in which a student can earn 5 DPE units.
 
No other format of internship would be considered for the award of DPE units. DPE units would be 
awarded only if training for the stipulated number of working days, as mentioned above, is completed 
to the satisfaction of the concerned Departmental DPE Committee. DPE units would not be awarded 
against partial completion of the internship duration.
ii) 
A student can choose from one of the following options in order to complete the requirements of Non-
Graded component  of Design / Practical Experience:
 
a. 
One semester internship, accounting for 5 DPE units.

Text on page:106
Courses of Study 2023-2024
101
 
b. 
One summer internship, accounting for 2 DPE units and 1 to 3 DPE units from other activities at 
the Institute
 
c. 
Two summer internships, accounting for a total of 4 DPE units, and if desired, 1 DPE unit from 
other activities at the Institute
 
d. 
No internships: all DPE units can be earned through design / project activities at the Institute
iii) A student can do at most two internships for DPE units, during his/her stay at the Institute. If any student 
does more than two internships, DPE units will be awarded for the first two registered internships only.
iv) Summer internships are allowed in the summer after the 4th registered semester of the student or later. 
Semester Internships are permitted from the 7th registered semester or later.
v) 
Internships are permitted in industry, research laboratories or academic institutions involved in research, 
development and / or technology transfer. Any student opting for semester long internship may also be 
allowed to work on a start-up. All internships must be approved by the departmental DPE committee in 
advance. In the case of non-industry internships, the work should be research / development / practice 
oriented, and not classroom course work.
vi) In all cases, for award of DPE units, after completion of the internship, the work must be evaluated by 
the DPE committee of the studentâs Department. In case the work is found wanting in any respect, the 
student(s) will be advised to do more work and reappear before the committee. In any case, partial 
award of DPE units would not be allowed.
vii) For self-arranged internships, any documentation regarding the bona fide status of students (while 
applying for training) will be provided by UG section.
8.6.3.1 Registration Procedure for Internships
Summer Internships:
i) 
At the beginning of first semester of each academic year, the data of all students who have earned at 
least 30 credits would be automatically enrolled by the OCS for internship in the subsequent summer.
ii) 
At the beginning of the internship in the following summer, the student must have completed 50 credits 
to be eligible.
iii) OCS sends out information to the students about the companies offering summer internships. Interested 
students can apply for the same.
iv) The students can also arrange for the internships on their own.
v) 
If a student is selected for an internship through OCS, he/she is bound to accept the internship. If 
the student does not take up or complete the internship, he/she will be debarred from all further OCS 
activities including further internship opportunities and placement procedure. This is to discourage 
non-serious students from depriving other students of the opportunity, and damaging the reputation of 
IIT Delhi with  the companies offering internships through OCS.
vi) The OCS would handle correspondences and training certificates of all internships arranged by the 
OCS.
vii) OCS will try and arrange internships for as many students as it can. However, it may not be possible 
for the OCS to arrange internships for all the students who participate in the process.
viii) The OCS typically starts the process of selections for internships in August and ends in February- March. 
The exact dates would be notified by the OCS each year.
ix) To claim DPE units for summer internships, a student is required to initiate activity XXT200 or XXT300 
on the NGU portal prior to the commencement of the internship. A student should register in XXT200 
if it is his/her first summer internship and XXT300 if it is second summer internship. The approval of 
initiation request will be as per the rules and regulations of the academic unit, which holds for both 
OCS arranged as well as self-arranged internships.
x) 
At the end of summer internship, a student is required to submit training report and training certificate 
to the department DPE coordinator. Further, student will also need to raise the completion request for 
the registered activity XXT200/300. DPE units will be awarded after the due evaluation procedure of 
the respective academic unit.

Semester Internship:
i) 
Semester internship, as mentioned in section 8.6.2.5, is permitted in the seventh registered semester 
or later, for students with at least 75 earned credits.
ii) 
A student needs to submit a request on the NGU portal for prior approval of semester internship. The 
request for  internship will be evaluated by the DPE committee of the studentâs parent Department and 
approved by the Institute DPE committee upon recommendation of the former.
iii) Process of monitoring / mentoring the internship is described in section 8.6.2.5. Upon completion, the 
student should submit a request on the NGU portal for approval of the completion of the internship 
through the supervisor and Departmental DPE committee to the Institute DPE committee. The grade 
for semester internship is awarded by the Institute DPE committee.

8.7 Overlapping Activities
Many of the activities listed under a given component in sections 8.1-9.6 could also qualify as valid activities 
under other non-graded components: for example, a technical project done as part of NEN203 may qualify to be 
submitted for DPE units under XXD35y, etc. Some of the technical projects may also qualify as valid activities under 
Minor / Mini / Major projects towards earning graded credits. In this regard, the following would be strictly followed: 
In case a project is evaluated for graded credits or for any other non-graded activity, it would not be allowed to 
be re-submitted for any other non-graded unit. While submitting the completion request of the project online, a 
student should submit an undertaking to this effect, approved online by the faculty supervisor of the project.
a) 
In the summer when student has registered for Summer Internship (either through OCS or self-arranged); 
they cannot be registered for any course or other institute activity.
b) 
Additional work which is not evaluated for such projects, either done prior to such projects or done after 
the completion of such projects, could be considered. In such a case, prior written permission must be 
taken from the concerned committee (PESR, DPE, etc.), explicitly describing components of work being 
submitted for the other graded / non-graded evaluations and for the current submission separately. In 
this regard, note the following examples:
 
The workshops organised by NSS and under NEN202 would be generally distinct. Under NEN202, 
workshops would have minimum duration of 5 days and would be designated as âPESR WORKSHOPâ. 
Workshops organized by NSS would not be counted for NEN202 and vice-versa.

of Bhartendu Harishchandra and the nationalist theatre of Calcutta â 
will be explored. Special attention would be paid to the transformation 
of theatre values with the intervention of the Indian Peopleâs Theatre 
Association (IPTA). The focus for the post-Independence period would 
be on the diverse energies of urban theatre, group theatre and the 
âback to the rootsâ movement. The course would require students to 
study play-scripts as well as look at accompanying literature to form

The course will begin by seeking to distinguish the notion of âcreativeâ 
writing. It will contrast this heterogeneous category with other kinds 
of writing such as the âfunctionalâ writing found in text-books and 
reportage. Through an analysis of various techniques of writing - in 
master-texts as well as studentsâ own productions - the course will 
explore why and how literary texts continue to be a prime source 
of emotional and intellectual stimulation across cultures. As far as 
possible, the course will focus on contemporary writing, given that 
writers write in the âhere and nowâ even as they imagine the future 
or return to past memories. Selected readings will be used to focus 
studentsâ attention on that most difficult of problems: to acquire a 
style of writing that makes a writerâs âvoiceâ both unique and universal. 
Finally, students will be required to write in some genre(s) of their 
choice. These genres will include the classic areas of poetry, fiction 
and play-writing but will neither exclude non-fiction genres like the 
essay and biography nor forms of writing thrown up by the ânew 
mediaâ such as blogs, photo-essays and narrative-writing for story-
boards and video-games.

What defines the Indian tradition? Is there a singular Indian tradition 
or is there a plurality of Indian traditions in the public sphere 
today? How do these find representation in the modern and textual 
frameworks? Is modernity antithetical to tradition?
The aim of this course is to take up these varied questions along 
with their nuances to understand and re-negotiate Indian intellectual 
traditions.
In this course, the examination of sources, structure, texts and 
exemplars from Indian intellectual tradition provide a theoretical 
framework for the discussion of contemporary political and social 
issues. Economic development, social justice, religion and the nation, 
communalism and secularism, caste, class and gender equality are

of reform and revival both in the past and in modern times will be 
highlighted to underline the need for rethinking Indian Philosophy 
and intellectual tradition in an academically rigorous manner.

The manner in which gender is conceptualized and performed is 
foundational to the understanding of human social relationships. 
Gender identities are not fixed or determined purely by physiology; 
their social construction affects ideas of masculinity and femininity or 
other sexual identities. Besides understanding how sex and gender 
are interrelated, we will look at how gender intertwines with societal 
areas of economy, technology, polity, religion and demography. The 
important role played by social structures and institutions such 
as caste, kinship, family, marriage, ethnicity, religion and class in 
structuring gender and vice-versa will be brought out.
Technologies associated with population and biological sciences have 
transformed and are continuing to transform society and human 
relationships in particular directions. The course will examine these 
transformations at the global and local levels and consider their 
impact on individual lives. Challenges posed to intimate human 
relationships and identities by new reproductive technologies such 
as invitro-fertilization, surrogacy, sex selection will be explored. What 
does the emergence/ institutionalization of new social forms - such 
as same sex marriages and parenthood by surrogacy - tell us about 
the possibilities and limits of human relationships?

categories
This course trains students to understand the social dynamics of 
different types of organisations, with a focus on practices of work 
and the making of workplaces. While familiarising students with the 
theoretical approaches and concepts necessary to understand the 
individual as relationship to the organisation, it will enable students to 
think critically about questions of identity, agency, power and control 
in organisational spaces. We discuss the interface of culture, ways 
of thinking, feeling, acting and being in different organisations. This 
enables a shift from the managerial perspectives and psycho-social 
views of organisations, and draws out the complex negotiations and 
tensions endemic to organisational life. The course also draws on 
literature on different types of organisations such as hospitals, prisons 
and corporations to elaborate the unique cultural configurations in 
these spaces and contexts.

Can evolutionary theories about language and tool-using help us 
understand how we continually manage today to process the world 
around us âonlineâ? On this course, the class will be introduced to 
some state-of-the-art discussions in the interdisciplinary field of 
cognitive studies. These topics will include: (i) the modularity of mind 
(ii) the content of consciousness, (iii) the language bio-programme 
hypothesis, (iv) the relativism versus universals of controversy; (v) 
strong and weak positions on AI, etc. The course will rely on down-
to-earth examples to demonstrate that such an interconnected area of 
study is not remote or esoteric but part of the intellectual excitement 
of living in the new millennium and attempting to anticipate both how 
it will shape us and how we will shape it.

There is more to romanticism than Wordsworthâs poetry, or even 
literature in general. Nor is it confined between 1780s and 1830s. 
Least is it a trend succeeded by Victorianism and realism, and 
assailed by modernism. Romanticism contends with the question 
of presentation â of representation of and to oneself. It therefore 
directly participates in the philosophical discussions of reason, 
sensibility, emotion, subjectivity, and most importantly the idea of 
human freedom. This course will familiarize students with romantic

movements in arts, in theories of language and society, in post-
Kantian philosophy, in attitudes tor religion. Romantics not only 
engaged in experimental social practices and literary collaborations, 
but also articulated their necessity for the first time. Can we say 
that romanticism is at an end? How does it contribute to both a 
nationalism rooted in folk tradition, and individualism expressed 
in the cult of the hero, the solitary intellectual? How does it both  
look back to medieval occult and forward to novelties of science?  
Why is romanticism fascinated with animals, monsters and  
machines alike?

assumptions behind experimentation and the defining its nature and 
scope. We will then introduce topics such as control, randomization, 
design, factors, etc. that will equip the students to understand and 
test a scientific prediction using experimentation. The module will 
be a mix of lectures and practical sessions. Practical sessions will 
complement core concepts taught in the lectures by allowing the 
students to design their own experiment, collect data and do some 
preliminary analysis.
Finally, in the module for computational methods, we will introduce 
the students to some examples of data analytics and basic machine 
learning models.

3 Credits (3-0-0) 
We will study the fundamental assumptions supporting the various 
definitions of text, and their possible mutual incompatibility, for the 
ways in which the question âwhat is a textâ exposes the issues in 
characterizing, interpreting and attributing meaning to text. The 
course will take into account hermeneutic, phenomenological and 
deconstructionist theories of text, the historicality of the idea of text, 
the distinctions between text and work, the metaphysics of text and

HUL741 Sociolinguistics: Language Variation, Culture 
and Society 
3 Credits (3-0-0) 
Pre-requisite(s): HuL 234, HuL242 and HuL 350 for uG or Prior 
Permission of Coordinator
This course aims at understanding variation mainly from a 
sociolinguistics perspective, but while also considering some relevant 
cues from generative views of the phenomenon. It will cover aspects 
of language change (bilingualism, multilingualism, language deaths, 
pidgin and creole formation etc.) as explained by feature-based and 
parameter-based grammars, as well by socio-cultural-political factors. 
The focus will then shift towards how homogenization of language 
also happens - combating the natural tendency towards variation - 
triggered by external factors. Concepts of race, gender, nation and 
identity will also be brought up to show the pervasive role of language 
in varied aspects of our socio-cultural-political lives.
HUL742 Transformational Theories of Language 
3 Credits (3-0-0) 
Pre-requisite(s): HuL 234, HuL242 and HuL 350 for uG 
students and/or prior permission of the course coordinator 
This course will cover the fundamental concepts that have defined 
generative/transformational grammars since their inception in the 
1950s. It will introduce students to the main motivations for such 
grammars for natural language, as stated in Chomsky (1957). 
A substantial part of the course will therefore be devoted to 
understanding the inadequacies of immediate constituent analysis 
and the need to include optional and obligatory transformational 
rules in the grammar. This will be followed by a detailed study of later 
theoretical developments, including those found in Standard Theory, 
Extended Standard Theory, Revised Extended Standard Theory and 
Government and Binding Theory.
HUL743 Language Acquisition, Teaching and Assessment 
3 Credits (3-0-0) 
This is a literature review course that will explore the existing 
literature in the domains of Language Acquisition (both first and 
second), Language teaching (approaches and methods), as well as 
language assessment. In doing so, the course will include aspects 
of the philosophy of language, and the resultant application of these 
philosophical approaches in the form of classroom pedagogy. The 
course will also include substantial literature on "action research" 
where language teachers have written about the results of 
implementing various cognitive tasks in their classroom.
HUL745 Psycholinguistics 
3 Credits (3-0-0) 
We will first introduce the relevant questions, theories, methodologies 
with regard to the historical trajectory of Psycholinguistics. We will 
then look at language processing at different linguistic dimensions. 
We will start with words, their meaning and access. We then look 
at processing sentences. The course will also cover important topics 
such as language and speech production. Reading processes (and 
its relation to processing) will be covered. We course will also cover 
the current theories of Bilingualism and Aphasia.
HUL746 Phonological Markedness 
3 Credits (2-0-2) 
Pre-requisite(s): HuL 234, HuL242 and HuL 350 for uG 
This course explores the connection between a unit of acoustic 
speech signal and its environment (sounds preceding or following  
it). Phonological theory is thus composed on context-free and 
context-sensitive notions of markedness. While these are supposed 
to be universal, individual languages might vary significantly in 
prioritizing between these. The course therefore involves a major 
practical component where the speech units of individual languages 
(vowels, consonants and tones) are studied with respect to their 
phonological contexts.
HSL747 Language Computations and Mental Architecture
3 Credits (3-0-0) 
Pre-requisite(s): HSL521, HSL541 
The course starts with a central tenet of language from the perspective 
of generative grammar, which is: recursion. We discuss the definition 
of recursion, differences between direct and indirect recursion, and 
its correlates to actual biological processes. We then move on to 
discuss if the same property defines other communicative systems, 
including those of non-human primates, insects and birds. Drawing 
on studies conducted on tamarin monkeys, ants, bees and zebra 
finches, we try to answer if the structure of the human mind is 
different from non-human minds, and if so, how. Are computational 
processes any less or more complex in the two sets of minds under 
consideration here? Some overarching themes running through 
the course are: (i) how does the nature-nurture debate play out 
in human and non-human linguistic systems, (ii) which parameters 
result from maturational processes that are innately specified, and 
which parameters are acquired by learning, (iii) whether the mental 
space is carved into modular compartments, where each module 
is an adaptive specialization to a particular problem or whether a 
non-modular mind serves as a general-purpose learning mechanism, 
(iv) what are the determinants of errors and (v) the constraints on 
imitation and production of language constructs when placed in 
contact or non-ideal situations.

nature made by various social science disciplines. 
HUL753 Philosophy of Science 
3 Credits (3-0-0)
The course will address three sorts of questions. The first set 
involves the status of science as a privileged source of knowledge: 
what, if anything, justifies this status? The second set involves 
concepts such as 'law' , 'cause', and 'explanation' which occur within 
scientific practice: how are these to be understood? The third set 
involves understanding the relationship between different scientific 
enterprises: is there a hierarchy of sciences ranging from physics at 
one end to the human or social sciences at the other? If so, how 
should this hierarchy be understood?

HSL789 Religion and Modern Society
3 Credits (3-0-0)
What is religion? What role does it play in modern democratic 
societies? How does it influence the everyday life-world, belief 
system, and identity of an individual or a community? And, what 
are the relationships between the sacred and secular or religion and 
modernity? Addressing these questions, this course examines the 
various concepts, theories and debates in the sociology/anthropology 
of religion. Contrary to the predictions of the secularisation hypothesis, 
which envisaged the decline or privatisation of religion with the 
spread of modernity and techno-scientific rationality, it is observed 
that there is a religious resurgence or de-secularisation of the world. 
Religion has assumed a more public role. Given this, the course will 
examine the implications of religionâs resurgence and active public 
role for modern democratic societies as well as the broader process 
of social order and social change.

the necessary skills.
HUL801 Law, Technology and Citizenship 
3 Credits (3-0-0)
Although there has been considerable focus in political theory and 
legal studies on the concept of citizenship, and its relationship with 
the law, through the last six decades, the study of the importance 
of technology to this relationship is only an emerging field. Four 
performative sites of citizenship discourse/citizen action viz., (a) 
human rights approaches and the regulation of technology, (b) 
Surveillance state and citizenship, (c) Technological ethics as a site 
for citizenship discourse, and d) Posthuman citizen, are focused 
upon to offer possible (conceptual and practical) implications for the 
ways in which âlaw and technologyâ impacts existing rights discourse. 
Further, four important sites of contemporary debates on technology 
and citizenship, viz., UID/Aadhaar, Human DNA profiling for crime 
control, nuclear technology and genetically modified technologies in 
agriculture are focussed on to contextualise the key issues that are 
identified in the earlier modules.

his is an advanced course in theoretical syntax and will benefit 
students interested in learning more about recent generative syntactic 
theories. There are two main objectives of the course: a) to provide 
the rationale for the âStrong Minimalist Thesis: language as an optimal 
systemâ; and, b) to learn to generate syntactic structures using fewer 
transformations/operations and features and, with stronger economy 
considerations. On finishing the course, students will be familiar with

3 Credits (2-0-2) 
Pre-requisite(s): HuL 234, HuL242 and HuL 350 for uG 
This course explores the connection between sounds and words. 
While the correlation between the meaning and sounds of a word are 
arbitrary, the string of sounds or phonological shape of words and 
other morphological units follow certain universal well-formedness 
principles. While many of these principles derive from the manner 
in which individual languages form rhythmic/ prosodic domains in 
speech, some make crucial reference to morphological notions such 
as homonymy and synonymy. The aim of the course is to impart 
certain theoretical tools to analyze words from any natural language 
data. Since the objective of the course is to learn to analyze natural 
language data, it involves a substantial practical component.
HUL843 Reading and Sentence Processing 
3 Credits (2-1-0) 
The course content will cover state-of-the-art models of reading. The

processing are related. Distributed (SWIFT) as well as undistributed 
(EZ Reader) attention models will be discussed. Influence of low-level 
factors (eg. Word length, word frequency, etc) and contribution of 
high-level sentential factors on reading patterns will be introduced. 
Work on Indian languages will be discussed. Finally, models that 
integrate sentence processing and reading will be taken up. 
[Note: once an eyetracker is available, hands on sessions will be 
conducted to run simple reading experiments. See tutorial section 
for more details.

Ethnographic perspectives on the state seek to open up the state to 
critical scrutiny, dislodging it as a monolithic conceptual or territorial 
apparatus. These studies allow us to think of the state beyond 
governmentality or bureaucracy, to engaging with the multiple ways 
in which state âeffectsâ shape our engagement with it. How does the 
âideaâ of the state constrain the way in which we âthinkâ the state? 
What are the ethnographic sites through which the state emerges 
as an object of study, e.g., bureaucracy, law, sexuality, marriage, 
citizenship, borders etc? The course will consist of seminars designed 
around a set of readings, which will be discussed in detail each week.
HUL872 Sexuality, Governmentality, and the State 
3 Credits (3-0-0) 
Sexual governance or state surveillance of issues pertaining to 
sexuality, marriage and mobility highlight the problematic division 
between the âpublicâ and the âprivateâ. The âintimateâ sphere is no 
longer one that is outside the purview of states; indeed the âprivateâ 
or the âintimateâ is often co-produced as a corollary of the public 
face of a stateâs legitimacy. Nationalism and patriotism are heavily 
grounded in issues pertaining to culture and sexuality, often thought 
of as âprivateâ. This course will provide a historical and sociological 
perspective to how sexual governance â the control of womenâs 
sexuality, conjugality and the definition of âmarriageâ and the âfamilyâ 
by a patriarchal state shows that the state has always concerned 
itself with the intimate lives of its citizens.
HUL873 Language, Culture and Society 
3 Credits (3-0-0) 
What is language? How does it relate to the âcollective consciousnessâ

to some theoretical approaches to the study of language in social 
anthropology, such as structuralism and Marxism. This will be followed 
by studies of language movements, language policy in colonial and 
postcolonial India. The course concludes with questions of âfree 
speechâ, âhate speechâ and some debates on censorship.

3 Credits (3-0-0) 
The course will study major concepts of historicality and revolution in 
order to examine the role played by revolution in bringing or blocking 
historical change, in breaking with certain social and intellectual 
patterns. It will respond to questions about the nature of the pre-
revolutionary moment emergent within existing historical situations 
and yet departing from them; the designation of selective historical 
moments as revolutionary; the variety of domains beyond the narrowly 
defined domain of politics that have seen revolution, for instance, in 
science, technology, social relations, and philosophy. With respect to 
political revolutions, how is a revolution in history analysed, and what 
happens to sovereignty? What is the role of violence in revolution as 
compared to other categories of history (period, epoch), and how does 
it affect language itself, both of literary representations of revolution 
and of historiography? 
HUL884 Environmental Ethics 
3 Credits (3-0-0)
Pre-requisite(s): HuL275
The course introduces different understandings about categories 
of âenvironmentâ and âenvironmentalismâ that have emerged in 
contemporary thought, and its implications to its study in within an 
ethics framework. It seeks to explore three tropes. First, is a foray into 
the nature-culture debate, a debate central to environmental ethics. It 
seeks to lay the basis for the field by tracing key texts in the debate, 
viz., how the category of ânatureâ is understood to be something 
which is external to humans. Second, we seek to understand the 
ways in which the âcrisisâ in environment is constructed, a crisis 
which then would require certain ethical approaches to amelioration 
of our relationship with our surroundings. Third, is an exploration of 
specific themes in the field of contemporary environmental ethics - 
critical environmental aesthetics, applied ethics in agriculture, and 
explore ethical frameworks from non Western realms like in the Indic 
context, and Buddhist environmental ethics. This course looks at the 
imperatives and politics that shaped the literatures and discourses 
that shaped environmental ethics as a distinct discipline. 
HUL885 Criticism, Crisis and Critique

of critique in the context of the crisis that accompanied 18th century 
âEnlightenmentâ, the rise of the public sphere, and colonialism; c) 
the relation of criticism and critique to literature and to metaphysical 
inquiry; d) the concepts and concerns that inform theoretical and 
critical activity today, i.e., the critiques of gender, religion, race 
and caste; e) the relation of critical theory to critical practice, e.g. 
application, evaluation, description, self-reflexivity, and resistance, as 
observed in various schools of literary theory and criticism.

HUL893 Literature and the City
The course examines in some detail the nature of the challenge 
that traditionally preoccupied European writers - how to map the 
experience of the modern city, and what representational strategies 
were adequate for capturing the opacity, the fragmentation, and the 
transitory nature of urban modernity. It goes on to investigate the 
contemporary postcolonial city in order to understand it in relation 
to late capitalism, globalization, migration, and postmodern culture, 
and the challenges these pose to classic modernity. It begins by 
providing an introduction to some of the most important literature 
on the city and the major theoretical debates around it, offering 
students a set of conceptual tools with which to approach the cityâs 
incommensurable realities, its problems and its potential. It moves 
on to a detailed analysis of a number of literary texts, examining 
some of the ways in which the disjunctive realities of city-life shape 
new modes of experience, creative expression, and solidarity, without 
losing sight of the inequities of gender, culture, class, and race that 
persist and indeed strengthen in the current global economic system.
